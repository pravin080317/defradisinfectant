Access to the SVT canvas app is restricted through Dataverse security roles. Three primary personas are defined: Team Manager, Caseworker, and QA Reviewer. Role-based logic controls visibility, permitted actions, and screen behavior:

Team Manager has admin-level access and can view all jobs, assign/reassign tasks, override decisions, and submit final verifications.

Caseworker can view and process only assigned jobs, perform sales verification, raise PAD updates, and view historical decisions.

QA Reviewer has read-only access to all completed jobs for review. They can mark a case as Pass (locked) or Fail (returned to Caseworker), and optionally reassign it.

Role information is used within the canvas app for conditional UI rendering and audit trail logging. Actions are tracked against the userâ€™s role for compliance and traceability.
