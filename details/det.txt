Perfect — here’s how you can clearly explain **what was fixed** for issues **#5 (GOV.UK Design System)** and **#6 (multiple HTML errors)**, and why you still need to verify the **generated files** before confirming closure:

For issues **#5 and #6**, here’s what we addressed as part of the template fixes:

**5. Doesn’t follow GOV.UK Design System**
We’ve updated the templates to align with GOV.UK styling and structural guidance.
This includes:

* Introducing consistent heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) and spacing between paragraphs.
* Replacing non-semantic `<div>` and layout tables with proper semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
* Adding meaningful `alt` text for logos and ensuring bilingual headings follow GOV.UK’s accessible presentation pattern.
* Updating page structure and margins to match GOV.UK typography and layout best practices for readability and print.

**6. Multiple HTML Errors**
We’ve reviewed and corrected markup syntax and structural issues across templates, including:

* Fixing unclosed or misnested tags (`</div>`, `</table>`, etc.).
* Replacing incorrect attributes (e.g., `width:` instead of `width=`).
* Ensuring consistent quotation marks and properly nested table elements.
* Removing redundant or invalid HTML elements (like unnecessary `<br>` or empty `<td>` used for spacing).

These changes make the templates **structurally valid** and ensure they pass HTML validation and accessibility checks.

However, since the **ETL process dynamically generates the actual HTML output**, we need to **verify the generated files** to ensure these template-level fixes have carried over correctly into the final outputs (i.e., that the dynamic content doesn’t reintroduce invalid tags, misalignment, or broken hierarchy).

Once we receive and review the nine generated HTML files from the DAL team, we’ll confirm the results and send a **detailed summary** to the Accessibility team showing:

* Which WCAG A/AA issues were fully resolved,
* Which remain pending ETL-side adjustments, and
* Validation screenshots/evidence for each fix.

Would you like me to make this into a **Teams-ready concise message** (3–4 lines) summarizing the same points for your project channel?



Here’s a clear and professional way to respond to that message:

Thanks for raising these points.

We’ve fixed the identified accessibility issues in the templates; however, until we verify the **generated HTML files**, we can’t confirm the exact status of each fix. Once the generated outputs are available, we’ll review them in detail and share a consolidated update with the Accessibility team outlining what’s been fixed and how each issue maps to the WCAG A/AA criteria.

For now, we’ll need **regular support from the Data Migration (DAL) team** to provide the nine HTML files generated from the updated templates. After we verify these outputs, the DAL team can then proceed to **implement and re-test** using the fixed templates to ensure the final accessibility compliance.

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter for posting directly in your Teams thread?
