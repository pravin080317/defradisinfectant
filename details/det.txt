A maintenance page is pre-configured and deployed via Azure Front Door during outages.

Automated monitoring and alerting via Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

Clear runbooks for incident response and rollback via DevOps pipelines.

All infrastructure is redeployable with source-controlled configuration.

Have you spoken to your department’s data protection officer about the decisions you’ve made?
