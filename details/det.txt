Here‚Äôs a clear summary of the conversation above, structured to help you document it for wider clarification or stakeholder communication:

---

### üîç **Portal Address Lookup & Validation ‚Äì Summary of Discussion**

#### 1. **What data source does the portal validate against ‚Äî VOA or Royal Mail?**

* **Answer:** The portal **currently uses the Gazetteer Ordnance Survey Address Lookup API**, which is **believed to be an internal endpoint**.
* **Action:** It needs confirmation with the **DAW (Data & Address Warehouse) team** to be sure of the exact backing data source behind the API.
* **Note:** It does **not use Royal Mail PAF**.

---

#### 2. **What happens if a postcode fails validation in the new portal?**

* If the **postcode/address match fails**, the system:

  * Marks the record as **‚ÄúAddress Match Failed‚Äù**.
  * Still proceeds to create the **Portal Request Submission** and **Request**.
  * However, **user must manually select the hereditament** (VOA property/address) later in the case journey to continue processing.

---

#### 3. **Is there reconciliation for LA‚ÄìVOA postcode mismatches?**

* **Answer:** Currently, **no automatic reconciliation exists**.
* Users can manually fix the address if it's incorrect.
* In the **case processing stage**, users **must select the correct hereditament** to move forward.

---

#### 4. **Does Front Door validate or correct uploaded address data (e.g., from bulk)?**

* Front Door **does not automatically correct address data**.
* If address lookup fails, it:

  * Still **creates a Portal Request Submission** and **Request** using the **original uploaded data**.
  * Requires users to **manually match the address to a hereditament** during case processing.
* Without selecting a hereditament, the **process cannot proceed further**.

---

#### 5. **Is address data pre-identified in Portal Request Submission?**

* **No.** The **Portal Request Submission stores string-based address lines** from the user.
* The address is only mapped when the user later selects the correct hereditament.

Let me know if you want this turned into a slide, email, or FAQ-style page.


Certainly. Here's the revised response, combining your points 4 and 5 into a complete and clear answer for **Question 3**:

---

### **3. Does the Front Door validate or reconcile uploaded address data (e.g., for LA‚ÄìVOA postcode mismatches)?**

* **No automatic reconciliation or validation occurs** between Local Authority (LA) and VOA data at the upload stage.
* **Front Door does not correct or pre-identify addresses** from uploaded data.
* If address lookup fails, the system:

  * **Still creates** a *Portal Request Submission* and a *Request* using the **original user-provided address**.
  * **Does not map the address to a hereditament** automatically.
* **During case processing**, users must **manually match the address to the correct hereditament** (VOA property).
* Without this manual selection, **the process cannot proceed further**.
