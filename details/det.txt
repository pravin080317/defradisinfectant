Default Page: A pre-built maintenance page provided by Microsoft.

Custom Page: A custom-designed maintenance page tailored to specific branding or messaging requirements.

Steps to be Performed:

Navigate to the Power Pages Admin Center for the target site.

Enable Maintenance Mode:

Go to the Maintenance Mode settings.

Toggle the switch to enable Maintenance Mode.

Choose Maintenance Page Option:

Option 1: Default Page

Select the default maintenance page provided by Microsoft.

No additional configuration is required.

Option 2: Custom Page

Ensure the site is inaccessible to users during maintenance.

Disable Maintenance Mode (Post-Maintenance):

Once maintenance is complete, disable Maintenance Mode to restore site access.

Action Items:

For Development Team:

Review the documentation and confirm the preferred option (default page or custom page).

If a custom page is chosen, design and upload the page to the Power Pages Admin Center.
