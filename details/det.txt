Power Pages Reset Runbook ‚Äì PPE Environment
Overview
Why is a Reset Needed?
In certain scenarios, Power Platform environments may require a reset to align with higher environments, resolve reference data issues, or recover from major inconsistencies. Since Case Management Solutions (Case Solutions) share the same environment as Power Pages (Portal Solutions), a reset is often triggered due to issues impacting Case Solutions, even though Power Pages is less dependent on reference data.

A reset is typically done one environment at a time to avoid disruptions and ensure a structured migration path.

Activities Performed During a Reset
When an environment reset occurs, the following key activities take place:

üîπ Case Solutions (Primary Reset Focus)
Reference Data Sync: Case Solutions heavily rely on Dataverse reference data, which is refreshed or restored as part of the reset.
Application Reconfiguration: Case Solutions require specific configurations and deployments to restore functionality.
üîπ Power Pages (Included in Reset Due to Shared Environment)
Even though Power Pages does not depend heavily on reference data, it requires post-reset activities to ensure continued functionality.
