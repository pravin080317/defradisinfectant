Key Positive Observations
Dashboard:

Headers, links, and structure were correctly read by JAWS.

GDS-compliant design helped with navigation and orientation.

Used Insert + ‚Üì to read the whole page.

Download Schedule Page:

JAWS correctly recognized headers and form fields.

Participant could navigate to radio buttons for file type selection.

Understood options for downloading (e.g., XML, CSV).

Found and activated the ‚ÄúDownload as XML‚Äù button successfully.

Table and Pagination:

Table headers were announced and sortable (e.g., "Published Date").

Sorting by column using keyboard was possible and accessible.

Pagination links (Page 1, 2, 3‚Ä¶) were navigable.

‚ùó Challenges Identified
Overwhelming Amount of Content:

JAWS reads from top-left to bottom-right; too many links and headings at once can be cognitively demanding.

Participant had to re-listen multiple times to understand layout.

Pagination Overload:

Multiple page links (20+) clutter the JAWS links dialog box.

Participant suggested a dropdown or filter/search to reduce overload.

Schedule Naming Convention:

File names (e.g., M011619-999-3330-Mar-2025) were cryptic and hard to distinguish.

User could not infer meaning without additional context (e.g., authority name, version).

Download Button Confusion:

A heading titled ‚ÄúDownload Schedule‚Äù caused confusion‚Äîit was not a button.

Actual button was below, but JAWS did not distinguish them clearly.

üìå Recommendations
Shorten file names or provide clearer descriptions next to them.

Clarify download button vs. heading with better semantic markup (e.g., role="button").

Introduce search/filter functionality for large lists of schedules.

Consider pagination alternatives like infinite scroll or dropdown selectors for keyboard users.

Test across multiple assistive tech tools and provide labels or tooltips consistently.
