1.1 High-Level Overview

The Sales Verification Tool (SVT) will serve as a unified platform that enables VOA caseworkers and managers to manage the end-to-end process of sales data validation. Caseworkers can search, review, and verify sales records originating from multiple sources such as LR PPD, WLTT, SDLT, and MILO. They will record outcomes and, where necessary, trigger data enhancement actions. Managers will conduct Quality Assurance (QA) using a dedicated workflow.

Verified and quality-assured results will be fed into downstream systems such as the Automated Valuation Model (AVM) and Valuation Tools, ensuring consistent, defensible, and auditable property valuations across the end-to-end Council Tax revaluation process.

The strategic objectives of SVT are to:

Support accurate, explainable, and efficient property valuations for the Welsh Revaluation 2028 programme

Enable structured validation of outlier and high-impact sales

Ensure auditability and traceability of sale verification decisions

Facilitate productivity improvements through a digital-first approach using Power Platform and Azure services
