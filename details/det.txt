Here are two Jira task entries that capture the required analysis for both scenarios described in the **Fix Errors** functionality for bulk upload:

---

### ‚úÖ **JIRA Task 1:**

**Title:**
üîç **Analyse Fix Errors Workflow ‚Äì Editable and Deletable Reports for Validation Errors**

**Description:**
Conduct a detailed analysis of the **Fix Errors** functionality where the **Front Door** identifies **data validation rule violations** in uploaded bulk reports (e.g., from Excel).

* Confirm that if validation fails on specific rows (e.g., 2 out of 5), only those entries appear as errors.
* Validate that the portal displays:

  * The 2 erroneous reports with inline **Edit** options.
  * The remaining 3 valid reports under **"No errors"** section.
  * A **‚ÄúDelete All Reports‚Äù** button at the bottom.
* Analyse feasibility and impact of **introducing a ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù option per individual report row**.
* Confirm all table dependencies, especially around:

  * `voap_portalrequestsubmission`
  * `voap_portalrequest`
  * `voap_portalfilemanagement`
  * Validation result tables (e.g., error summary or error logs if present).
* Note that all deletions must continue to follow the **soft delete** approach (status update, not hard delete).

Deliverables:

* End-to-end flow diagram
* List of impacted tables and status flags
* UI/UX suggestion for per-report delete
* List of rule sources (e.g., Front Door validation rules)

### ‚úÖ **JIRA Task 2:**

**Title:**
üö´ **Analyse Fix Errors Behaviour ‚Äì Processing Error with No Rule Match**

**Description:**
Analyse the system behaviour for bulk uploads where the **Front Door fails to match any validation rules** to the error.

* Confirm that such reports are shown with **Processing Error** in the Fix Errors screen.
* Verify that in this case:

  * **No Edit/Delete buttons** are shown for individual reports.
  * **Only status messages** (e.g., "Report cannot be processed") are shown to the user.
* Identify the backend reason for uneditable state:

  * No matched validation rule?
  * Blob file unreadable?
  * Error type not mapped?
* Trace data lineage across tables:

  * `voap_portalfilemanagement` (for status: Processing Error)
  * `voa_frontdoorheader` and `voa_frontdoorerror`
  * Any error mapping or rule engine table
* Validate if retry/resubmission path exists or needs to be implemented.

Deliverables:

* Root cause mapping for Processing Error without rule match
* List of involved entities and their error status
* Recommendation on user guidance (tooltip, error reason display)
