Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a polished version with that HMRC-wide statement included, so the picture is complete and consistent:

## üîê LA Portal Security ‚Äì Authentication & Authorization

### **Authentication (Who can sign in)**

* Across **HMRC streams**, there is a **single Azure Entra ID tenant**.
* For each stream (e.g., LA Portal, Risk Engine, etc.), authentication is restricted by **Entra ID security groups**.
* In the LA Portal, **council users** are onboarded through an **ECS-managed Access Package** (`VOA-BST-PRD`).
* This adds them into the designated **Entra ID group** (`DYN-D365-PRD-GUEST-SC`).
* Only users in this group can successfully authenticate to the **Prod portal**.
* **Dataverse environments** (DEV, FAT, UAT, PREPROD, PROD) are separate, and each environment has its own Contact table ‚Äî meaning users are mapped only where required.
* This ensures authentication is controlled centrally, but environment-level access is segregated.

---

### **Authorization (What they can access after sign-in)**

* After authentication, the portal checks Dataverse for a **Contact record** linked to the Entra ID user.
* Each Contact is associated with:

  * The correct **Local Authority (Account)**, and
  * A **Web Role** (`CT User`).
* **Table Permissions** tied to the Web Role determine what the user can read or update.
* Internal line-of-business tables have **no portal permissions**, so they are never exposed.
* This ensures council users can only access **staging tables** intended for portal use.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* **Authentication** is enforced centrally through HMRC‚Äôs **single Entra ID tenant**, with environment-specific access controlled via groups and access packages.
* **Authorization** is handled within each Dataverse environment via **Contacts, Accounts, Web Roles, and Table Permissions**.
* This combined model ensures that:

  * Only approved users can authenticate.
  * Even authenticated users are restricted to **only the data and environment they are meant to see.**

Would you like me to **condense this into a one-page briefing** (with bullets + a diagram) so you can drop it straight into your EA meeting deck?
