1️⃣ Editing Download Schedules & Help Section
Currently, there is no separate knowledge base maintained for the LA Portal.
The Power Pages web page template contains detailed descriptions of each screen, explaining how and what needs to be done.
If changes are needed, a portal pipeline deployment is required.
If an SRS-specific role is required for future updates, we need to define its scope and responsibilities.
2️⃣ Dashboards for Authorities
There are no dashboards in Dynamics 365 for LA Portal.
Power BI is used for Performance Analyst activities.
Internal users will access the Power BI dashboard directly.
The Performance Analyst (PA) will send summary reports to internal users as needed.
Any future dashboard requirements should be reviewed based on user needs.
3️⃣ Portal Monitoring & Assigned Role
Monitoring is handled via the Power Platform Admin Center.
More details can be found in the Jira ticket BST-110608.
There are ongoing discussions around using the VOA Portal Admin role for support users to oversee the portal.
4️⃣ Read-Only Role for Performance Analyst (Page 46/47 Access Method)
The Performance Analyst has been assigned the "VOA BST Programme Read Only User" security role in SIT for validation.
If this role successfully fulfills the Day 1 requirement, the VOA Read-Only SRS role will be provided in PROD.
This is being actively discussed with Liam, as referenced in [BST-118773] User Tracking PA LA Portal - VOA JIRA.
Any refinements needed in the role design or permissions will be evaluated based on feedback from testing.
