Summary of the Discussion on SSL Certificate and Private Key Handling in ADO Repo
Context & Background
An SSL certificate with a private key was found in an Azure DevOps (ADO) repository.
This certificate was used in a dress rehearsal deployment in September.
The issue originated because the private key password was missing, making it unusable.
To bypass this, a workaround was applied by exporting the certificate via a VM and re-importing it with a new password.
The certificate was then uploaded to ADO repo as a temporary measure for secure transfer between teams.
