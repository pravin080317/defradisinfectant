Step 1: Delete Old App Registration - Post Reset Activity
Why is this step necessary?
After a reset, old app registrations from the previous environment instance may still exist. These outdated app registrations can cause authentication issues, conflicts with the new environment setup, and unauthorized access problems. Removing them ensures that only the newly provisioned app registrations are in use.

Steps to Delete Old App Registration
1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Old App Registration

Sign in to the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) Portal:
üëâ https://entra.microsoft.com
Navigate to Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App Registrations
Search for any old app registrations related to PPE Power Pages Portal
Verify the application name and Client ID
2Ô∏è‚É£ Backup Existing Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

Before deleting, note down the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Redirect URIs for reference.
Store this in a secure location in case rollback is needed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the Old App Registration

Click on the identified app registration
Navigate to Properties ‚Üí Delete
Confirm deletion
Ensure the app is completely removed from the Enterprise Applications section as well.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify No Active Dependencies

Check Power Pages Authentication Settings in Power Platform Admin Center
Ensure no references exist to the deleted app
If authentication breaks, reconfigure with the new app registration.
Post-Deletion Validation
‚úÖ Confirm that authentication is working correctly in PPE Power Pages Portal
‚úÖ Verify new app registration is active and mapped to Power Pages authentication settings
‚úÖ Ensure no old credentials are stored in Azure Key Vault or Dataverse
