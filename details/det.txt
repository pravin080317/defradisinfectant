Hereâ€™s a simple and clear update for Section 6: Infrastructure and Assets based on the image and architecture diagram you shared:

6. Describe the infrastructure and assets on which the data processing activity relies

The Sales Verification Tool (SVT) operates on a cloud-first, low-code infrastructure primarily hosted within Microsoft Azure and the Power Platform ecosystem.

IT Systems & Software:

Power Platform (Canvas App, Model-Driven App) â€“ Used for user interaction and workflow logic.

Azure SQL (Valuation as a Service) â€“ Acts as the main data store for sales records and verification outcomes.

Dataverse Virtual Tables â€“ Provide a secure and efficient interface between the UI and Azure SQL via API.

API Management â€“ Secures and standardizes access to backend services and APIs.

Azure Data Lake and Databricks â€“ Used for large-scale sales data processing and modelling.

SharePoint Online â€“ Hosts reference documents and images used during sales verification.


Data Transmission Channels:

Secure HTTPS connections via Power Platform connectors and Azure API Management.

Azure Functions handle background data movement, including scheduled ingestion of external files from SharePoint to Azure Storage.


People:

Internal users such as Caseworkers, Managers, and QA Reviewers interact with the tool.

Technical and support teams maintain the APIs, integration services, and monitoring components.


Security and Hosting:

Entirely hosted within Microsoft Azure with role-based access, audit logging, and tenant-level policy enforcement.
