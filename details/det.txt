How have you resolved conflicts with standards or guidance in your tech choices (e.g., JavaScript dependence)?
Where custom JavaScript was necessary (e.g., dynamic field validation), it was written with accessibility in mind and tested against WCAG 2.1.

Styling uses Gov.UK CSS and templates added as Web Files in Power Pages, with careful overrides only where necessary.

All code is documented, security-reviewed, and accessibility-tested in collaboration with internal assurance teams.
