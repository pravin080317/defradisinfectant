Slide 1: Technology Stack Overview
Service Name: Local Authority (LA) Reporting Portal
Platform: Microsoft Power Platform, Azure

Frontend:

Power Apps Portal (Power Pages)

HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Gov.UK Design System

Azure Entra ID (B2B) for authentication

Backend:

Microsoft Dataverse (core data entity storage)

C# Plugins for custom business logic

Azure Functions for validation, schedule processing

Integration:

Azure API Management (APIM) for secured API exposure

Azure Blob for file storage

SDES/Integration Framework for ECS & HMRC data transfer

Exchange Online for notifications (Microsoft 365)

Slide 2: System Architecture (based on diagram)
Users:

Local Authority users authenticated via Azure Entra ID

Presentation Layer:

Power Apps Portal with embedded forms, schedule views, and dashboards

Processing Layer:

Dataverse stores request data

Custom C# plugins perform server-side logic

Azure Functions handle file validation and transformation

Front Door manages file ingestion and routing

Application Insights monitors performance and errors

Integration Layer:

Azure APIM secures all traffic to APIs

SDES for secure data submission to ECS/HMRC

Exchange Online for notifications

Downstream Systems:

BST SharePoint APIs, DAL, and PVDB for downstream data processing

Vestibule for ingestion into processing pipelines

Azure Blob stores uploaded files after virus scan

Slide 3: Security & Resilience
Security Controls:

Entra ID (B2B) authentication

Virus scanning via SDES

WAF, throttling, and rate limits via Azure Front Door and APIM

Role-based access and table-level permissions

Monitoring & Alerts:

Application Insights and Azure Monitor

Automated alerting and dashboards

Disaster Recovery & Uptime:

DevOps deployment with rollback capability

Maintenance page for user notification during downtime

Data recovery from Dataverse and Azure Blob (geo-redundancy enabled)

Slide 4: Openness, Reuse & Future Plans
Openness & Reuse:

Follows open standards (OAuth2, REST, OpenAPI)

Gov.UK Design System used for frontend compliance

Plans to open source reusable plugins and validation scripts

Reuses Microsoft common platforms (Power Platform, Azure)

Planned Enhancements:

Integration with GOV.UK Notify

Improved schedule publishing via public APIs

Explore use of AI for anomaly detection in bulk file submissions
