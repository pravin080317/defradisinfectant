You're right — the error likely means you're running into a syntax issue or the query structure isn’t recognized by the Kusto engine. Let’s clarify and provide **working, copy-paste ready KQL queries** for tracking page views from Application Insights:

---

### ✅ 1. **Total Page Views Per Day**

```kql
pageViews
| summarize totalViews = count() by bin(timestamp, 1d)
| order by timestamp desc
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Page Views by Page Title and URL**

```kql
pageViews
| summarize totalViews = count() by name, url
| order by totalViews desc
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Page Views by User ID**

```kql
pageViews
| extend userId = tostring(customDimensions.userId)
| summarize totalViews = count() by userId
| order by totalViews desc
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Page Views by User ID and Page Name**

```kql
pageViews
| extend userId = tostring(customDimensions.userId)
| summarize totalViews = count() by userId, name
| order by totalViews desc
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Unique Users per Page**

```kql
pageViews
| extend userId = tostring(customDimensions.userId)
| summarize uniqueUsers = dcount(userId) by name
| order by uniqueUsers desc
```

---

### ✅ 6. **Page View Timeline for Specific User**

```kql
pageViews
| extend userId = tostring(customDimensions.userId)
| where userId == "YOUR_USER_GUID_HERE"
| project timestamp, name, url
| order by timestamp asc
```

---

If your telemetry isn’t enriching `customDimensions.userId`, you can replace it with:

```kql
tostring(customDimensions["userId"])
```

Let me know if you'd like queries that also show session ID or correlate it with custom events (`customEvents` table).
