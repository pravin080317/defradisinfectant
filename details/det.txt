You're absolutely right. Here's the **corrected and finalized summary** with that clarification:

### ‚úÖ Accessibility Issues & Fixes Summary (Evidence Page)

| **Issue Reported**                                                            | **Compliant Fix Implemented**                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Error summary focus not set**<br>Fails WCAG 2.4.3 (Focus Order)          | Focus now moves to `#error-summary` using `focus()` and `tabindex="-1"` for screen readers.   |
| **2. Page title doesn‚Äôt update after error or action**                        | Title is **prefixed with "Error:" only when validation fails**, ensuring screen reader alert. |
| **3. Heading and title mismatch**                                             | `<h1>` is now consistent with the `<title>` in all page states (upload, remove, etc.).        |
| **4. Notification banner above `<h1>` not visible with magnification**        | Removed banner. Replaced with GOV.UK compliant `inset-text` messages for feedback.            |
| **5. Screen reader not alerted when upload section appears**                  | Added `aria-live="polite"` and focus to the upload table section (`#hideshow`) dynamically.   |
| **6. Users unclear about next steps after clicking "Add"**                    | Added `inset-text` for guidance: ‚ÄúFile added. Select ‚ÄòContinue to upload‚Äô to proceed.‚Äù        |
| **7. After removing last file, user left without context**                    | When last file is removed, inset appears **below `<h1>`** and focus returns to file input.    |
| **8. ‚ÄúChange‚Äù functionality resets focus (reported but not applicable here)** | Not applicable ‚Äì no ‚ÄúChange‚Äù button on the Evidence page.                                     |

### ‚úÖ Summary of Enhancements

* **Inset text used in three cases**:

  * Below `<h1>` when all files are removed.
  * Within table section on file addition.
  * Focus is managed for each message.
* **Banners removed** to reduce clutter and align with GOV.UK guidelines.
* **File input remains the primary focus target** post-action (esp. on remove).
* **ARIA & screen reader improvements**: clear roles, live regions, and labels.

Certainly. Here's a **short and clear explanation** to defend the decision:

### üîπ Page Title Not Updating After Action ‚Äì Clarification

* The **page title is updated with `Error:` prefix only during validation failures**.
* This aligns with **WCAG 3.3.1 (Error Identification)** to clearly signal an error state to screen reader users and support assistive technologies.
* **For successful actions** (like add or remove), we **retain the original page title** to avoid unnecessary page noise or confusion, as the heading and context remain the same.
* User feedback for successful actions is provided via **inset text**, which is screen-reader and magnifier friendly, ensuring clear next-step guidance without altering the page identity.
