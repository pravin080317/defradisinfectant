Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs start structuring the **SVT (Sales Verification Tool) ‚Äì Low-Level Design (LLD)** step by step.

Here‚Äôs a clear, HMRC-aligned **draft for the first section: Business Background**, written to fit the Welsh Revaluation 2028 context and suitable for inclusion in the LLD template.

## **1. Business Background**

The **Sales Verification Tool (SVT)** is a core component of the Welsh Revaluation 2028 programme, supporting the **Valuation Office Agency (VOA)** in validating residential sales data used for Council Tax banding. The tool enables valuers, caseworkers, managers, and QA users to verify sales evidence sourced from **Land Registry (LR), MILO, and SDLT/WLTT** against property attributes and Automated Valuation Model (AVM) outputs.

SVT facilitates data-driven decision-making by allowing users to:

* Review, validate, or exclude property sales from the valuation evidence set.
* Record verification outcomes and QA decisions through structured screens and workflows.
* Maintain complete audit trails of all user actions and API interactions.
* Feed validated evidence into the **Valuation Tool (VT)** for batch analysis and band margin refinement.

SVT replaces manual Excel-based verification with a **centralized, API-driven Power Platform interface** backed by **Azure SQL** as the master data store. Unlike previous implementations, **no data is stored in Dataverse**; instead, data is consumed and updated via APIs exposed through **Azure API Management (APIM)**, ensuring scalability and governance alignment with the DAP2 architecture.

The tool supports personas such as:

* **Caseworker** ‚Äì performs sales verification and records outcomes.
* **Manager** ‚Äì reviews case allocation and workload balancing.
* **QA (Quality Assurance)** ‚Äì performs random or triggered checks for data accuracy.

The SVT solution aligns with the wider **Valuation Ecosystem**, integrating with AVM, SBL (Stand Back & Look), and DLM (Dual List Maintenance) processes to ensure verified sales evidence is available for valuation modelling, PAD updates, and audit reporting.

Would you like me to move next to **‚Äú2. Scope & Objectives‚Äù** or **‚Äú2. System Architecture Overview‚Äù** (since both usually follow Business Background in LLD)?
