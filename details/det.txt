Perfect ‚Äî let's walk through **exactly what to change**, and how to implement the **GOV.UK summary list pattern** for the **postcode + change link** section **accessibly and cleanly**, including:

- ‚úÖ HTML structure changes (what to remove and replace)
- üß† JavaScript changes (if needed)
- üîÅ What‚Äôs being replaced with what

---

## üß© STEP 1: What you're currently doing (that needs changing)

### ‚ùå Current HTML pattern (problematic):

This appears **after address lookup is successful**:

```html
<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong id="pc-success"></strong>
  <a href="#" onclick="resetSelect(); event.preventDefault();" class="govuk-link govuk-1-margin-left-3">
    Change <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">your postcode</span>
  </a>
</p>
```

### ‚ùå Why this is a problem:

- It appears **between the label and the `<select>`** field.
- It‚Äôs not semantically clear (no key-value structure).
- Screen readers may not connect "Change" to "Postcode".
- It violates [WCAG 2.2 SC 3.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html).

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 2: Replace it with the GOV.UK **summary list pattern**

### ‚úÖ Replace the above `<p>` block with:

```html
<dl class="govuk-summary-list govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">Postcode entered</dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value" id="pc-summary-postcode">SW1A 1AA</dd>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__actions">
      <a href="#" class="govuk-link" onclick="resetSelect(); event.preventDefault();">
        Change<span class="govuk-visually-hidden"> postcode</span>
      </a>
    </dd>
  </div>
</dl>
```

### üß† Replaces:
- `<strong id="pc-success">‚Ä¶</strong>`
- The separate `<a>Change‚Ä¶</a>`
- Keeps them grouped properly for screen reader context

---

## üß© STEP 3: Update JavaScript to populate the postcode value

Currently, your code does:

```javascript
document.getElementById("pc-success").innerText = $('#postcode').val();
```

### ‚úÖ Update it to instead target the new summary list cell:

```javascript
document.getElementById("pc-summary-postcode").innerText = $('#postcode').val();
```

> üìç That‚Äôs the **only JS change needed** to populate the postcode dynamically.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary: What changes where

| Location | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| **HTML** | Replace `<p><strong id="pc-success">...</strong> <a>Change</a></p>` with the summary list markup |
| **JS** | Replace `pc-success` population with `pc-summary-postcode` |
| **Accessibility** | You now meet WCAG 3.3.2 by giving screen readers a semantically meaningful and properly grouped label-value-action structure |

---

### Optional Enhancement (JS fallback)
If you're dynamically injecting postcode in other places, also update:

```javascript
$('#pc-summary-postcode').text($('#postcode').val());
```

Let me know if you'd like me to give you a **full snippet** combining this with the `<label>` and `<select>` for the full final markup!
