Welsh (cy-GB) is not an officially supported language within Power Pages’ out-of-the-box multilingual hierarchy. The platform’s built-in multilingual framework only supports a predefined list of languages, and Welsh is not included. As a result, enabling the native multilingual configuration does not automatically create localized child pages, URLs (for example, /cy-gb/hafan), or system strings in Welsh. To ensure bilingual compliance without relying on unsupported configurations, we are proposing a hybrid Dataverse-driven approach. In this model, English content remains authored within existing Power Pages pages and templates, while Welsh text is stored and managed centrally in a Dataverse table. The page retrieves and renders the Welsh content dynamically when the user selects “Cymraeg.” This provides a maintainable, performant, and fully supported method to meet Welsh language requirements within current Power Pages capabilities.
