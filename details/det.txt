### **Usability in Dynamics 365 – Implemented Platform (SVT Context)**

The Sales Verification Tool (SVT) user interface has been developed within the existing **Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App**, using **Canvas App Custom Pages** to deliver flexible, role-based screens aligned to VOA personas (Caseworker, Manager, QC). The design follows GOV.UK and HMRC usability guidelines while leveraging Microsoft Power Platform's rapid prototyping capabilities.

* ✅ The solution uses **Canvas App-based Custom Pages**, embedded into the Council Tax model-driven app. These pages are built using **standard Power Apps controls**, which are **WCAG-compliant by design**, providing accessibility support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.

* ✅ Rather than starting with Miro wireframes, the prototype was rapidly built using **Power Apps Out-of-the-Box (OOB) components**, enabling early user feedback and accelerated business engagement.

* ✅ Screens are structured around **persona roles** (Caseworker, Manager, QC), with access-controlled dashboards and workflows tailored to each role's responsibilities.

* ✅ The **Low-Level Design (LLD)** phase will finalise the UI layout, focusing on interaction flows, tab ordering, field validations, and context-aware help or hints where necessary.

* ✅ The **View Sales Record** screen has multiple data sections (Hereditament, Banding, Sale Summary, LR/MILO/WLTT data, Property Attributes, Hyperlinks, QA, etc.), which requires **vertical scrolling** due to content volume. This trade-off ensures clarity without overloading the user on a single view.

* ✅ Pages make use of **Power Platform components** like:

  * Power Apps form and gallery controls
  * **PCF components** for tabular layout and formatting (e.g., DetailsList)
  * SharePoint image galleries for room condition display
  * Custom command buttons with role-aware logic (e.g., ‘Promote to Master’, ‘Submit’, ‘Calculate’)

* ✅ The application complies with **HTML5 standards** and provides **device-agnostic UI support**, including:

  * Compatibility with all HMRC-supported browsers: **Chrome, Edge, Mobile Safari**
  * Usability across **desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile**
  * No dependency on browser plugins or client-side installations

* ✅ The primary user interaction mode is **desktop browser**, but mobile usability is also supported in read-only or basic input scenarios.

* ✅ All screens and navigation are designed for **clarity and consistency**, minimizing cognitive load and improving user efficiency.

* ✅ **Accessibility and usability testing** will be validated during the test phases, with any improvements fed back into iteration cycles. SRF usability engagement is required as internal-facing UI has been amended.

## **Navigation Within the Application – SVT**

The SVT solution follows consistent and accessible navigation principles aligned to GOV.UK and HMRC standards, delivered using **Dynamics 365 with embedded Canvas App Custom Pages**. The navigation experience is streamlined for ease of use by VOA internal staff personas (Caseworker, Manager, QC), with contextual access and clearly segregated workflows.

---

### **Navigation Within the Application**

* The **left navigation pane** of the Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App provides entry points into “**SVT (Sales Verification Tool)**” and “**Valuation Tool**”.
* Navigation labels avoid acronyms (e.g., "Search Reval Sales Record" instead of "SRR").
* Navigation structure is kept **simple and role-segregated**, with grouping by function (e.g., Caseworker tools vs QC tools).
* **Icons are supported with clear labels** to aid screen reader accessibility.
* Power Platform’s responsive layout ensures navigation works seamlessly on different screen sizes, though core use is expected via desktop.

### **Pages (Canvas Custom Pages in Dynamics)**

Custom Pages have been created and embedded within the Dynamics app, with persona-based access:

| **Page Title**               | **Accessible by** | **Purpose**                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Search Reval Sales Record`  | All personas      | Advanced search screen to query and filter sales from PostgreSQL via virtual table |
| `My Allocated Work`          | Caseworker        | Grid of assigned tasks; launches into verification journey                         |
| `Manager Dashboard`          | Manager           | KPIs, summaries, and quick stats on overall progress                               |
| `Manager Assignment`         | Manager           | Interface to bulk-assign or reassign verification tasks                            |
| `Quality Control Dashboard`  | QC Reviewer       | Overview of submitted verifications; status-wise and reviewer progress             |
| `Quality Control Assignment` | QC Reviewer       | Screen to self-assign QC tasks or review others' submitted work                    |

Each page loads within the Dynamics context, offering single-click return navigation and breadcrumb paths for easy tracking.

### **Sales Verification Form – Subpages/Sections**

The **Sales Record Form** (Canvas or Form component) consists of multiple collapsible/scrollable sections:

| **Section**                | **Purpose**                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Hereditament Info`        | Basic property identifiers: Address, Coordinates, Billing Authority   |
| `Banding`                  | Band reference, Band ID, and current/proposed band                    |
| `Sale Summary`             | Sale price, transaction date, outlier flag, ratio, model comparison   |
| `Sales Verification`       | "Useful" toggle, reasons for non-usefulness, and notes                |
| `Condition Score (Canvas)` | Detailed room condition entries (Kitchen, Bathroom, Decoration, etc.) |
| `Sale Calculations`        | Previous/Current ratio, flags, HPI factors                            |
| `LR PPD / MILO`            | LR PPD details or MILO fields (conditionally hidden)                  |
| `WLTT`                     | WLTT details (Transaction price, lease, tenure, agents, etc.)         |
| `Hyperlinks`               | Clickable buttons to EPC, GSV, Zoopla, RightMove, VMS                 |
| `Property Attributes`      | Attribute string for audit/debug reference                            |
| `QA Section`               | Comments box, decision dropdown, and submit button for QC stage       |

Pages are expected to scroll due to the number of logical sections. Navigation between records (next/prev) is offered for efficiency during verification.

### **Dashboards and Views**

SVT includes **role-specific dashboards** using Power Apps components and standard Dynamics dashboard controls:

| **Dashboard**          | **Audience** | **Features**                                                       |

| `QC Dashboard`         | QC Reviewer  | Items awaiting review, pass/fail ratio, workload tracking          |

**Views** (via PCF grid or gallery control) provide:

* Filtering by Outlier, Postcode, UPRN, and Sale Status
* Inline “View Record” buttons for deep dive
* Visual indicators (flags, badges) for quick scanning
