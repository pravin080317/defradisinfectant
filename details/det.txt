### **RFC Title:**

External User Onboarding & Portal Code Updates Deployment – 09/07/2025

---

### **Change Description:**

This RFC covers the onboarding of external users into the LA Portal and deployment of minor code changes. The change involves uploading user data, configuring portal access, and deploying fixes to improve usability and accessibility.

---

### **Scope of Change:**

#### **User Onboarding Activities (16:00–18:00):**

1. **User Provisioning (16:00–17:00):**

   * Import the finalized Excel into the Portal User Setup Table.
   * Re-import the same records with status change to trigger Power Automate flow and complete setup.

2. **Verification Steps (17:00–18:00):**

   * Use Advanced Find to confirm user status in the setup table.
   * Validate Contact creation and access roles in the Portal.
   * Perform any remediation if issues are observed.

3. **Excel Columns to be Populated by Portal Dev Team:**

   * Comments
   * Portal Status
   * Council ID
   * Web Role ID

#### **Code Changes Included in This Deployment:**

* Update UI labels: Change the word **“Private”** to **“Public”** in applicable portal views.
* **Enable/Disable Submit and Upload buttons**: Add logic to restrict re-submission or re-uploads once submitted.
* **Normalize file extension**: Automatically convert uploaded file extensions to lowercase for consistency.
* **Minor Accessibility Fixes**: Improve screen reader compatibility and label associations.

---

### **Implementation Plan:**

* **Pre-requisites Complete**: Guest users created and access packages assigned.

* **Dev Team**: Will test code changes in lower environments before deploying to Production.

* **Deployment Window**:

  * Scheduled: 09/07/2025 (16:00–18:00 BST)
  * Monitoring & Validation: 03/06
  * **Contingency Day**: 04/06 reserved for forward fixes.

* **Post Deployment**:

  * Portal cache will be cleared to reflect changes.
  * Code deployment validation will be done via the Portal Management app in Power Pages.

---

### **Worst-Case Scenario Risk:**

Minimal. If there are any pipeline or deployment errors, the release will **not proceed**. Previous build (v1.1.1.001) will be redeployed in case of rollback.
