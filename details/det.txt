KEY OBJECTIVES FROM DIAGRAM:
Retire the hotfix approach (patch directly to PROD) to avoid rework and code divergence.

Separate development streams for:

BAU Defect Fixes & Minor Enhancements

Major Features (Release 2.0)

Microsoft Wave Updates (platform-level)

Introduce merge stages for validated releases.

Streamline environments – Repurpose unused/test environments (FAT, MOFF, HOTFIX).

Enhance automation and synchronization across all channels.

Introduce “Training” as a PROD-like environment for onboarding and demos.

🧱 ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE BREAKDOWN
🔴 HOTFIXING CHANNEL (To Be Removed)
HOTFIX (U) and HOTFIX (M):
Used to apply emergency patches directly to production.
➤ Issue: No code reuse. Patches had to be reworked into the BAU stream.

🔵 BAU MAIN CHANNEL (Primary Dev/Defect Fix Path)
Focus: Defect remediation, BAU change requests.

DEV (BAU) → Active development (unmanaged)

DEV MASTER → Managed code; pre-SIT validation

SIT → Fully integrated testing (DAL, Azure, QUA)

UAT → Exploratory testing, stakeholder sign-off

PPE → Pre-Prod/Smoke testing

PROD → Live Production

TRAINING → Replica of PROD for onboarding/training

📌 Important Note: SIT is the only fully integrated environment (legacy systems, MDTP, IFS), hence it's the single point for full end-to-end validation.

🟢 RELEASE 2.0 DEVELOPMENT CHANNEL
Focus: Major features & business transformations (e.g. aggregation, disaggregation, NDR → CT).

DEV (R2.0) + PROD MIRROR → Feature branch development

DEV (R2.0) MERGE → Consolidated staging before deployment into BAU

Merges into SIT → Then flows through to PROD

📌 Strategy: Maintain sync between R2.0 and BAU streams through controlled merges.

🟡 MICROSOFT WAVE UPDATE CHANNEL
Focus: Dynamics 365 Platform updates (e.g. March & Sept releases).

DEV (MS) + PROD MIRROR → Clone of PROD with platform-only changes

DEV (MS) MERGE → Used to validate Wave releases before applying to main PROD

📌 Avoids doing MS Wave testing in actual PROD or BAU environments.

🔄 ENVIRONMENTS TO BE REPURPOSED
Located in orange boxes:

FAT (x) → Becomes DEV (R2.0)

MOFF (x) → Becomes DEV (MS)

HOTFIX (U) → Becomes DEV (R2.0) MERGE

HOTFIX (M) → Becomes DEV (MS) MERGE

🟪 STREAMS & THEIR PURPOSE (Bottom Legend)
Stream	Development Channel
BAU/Defect Remediation	BAU Main Channel
Welsh Reform	Also BAU (CRs & Appeals)
Release 2.0	Dedicated feature release stream
Business Training/Play	Use Training environment for this
🧩 ICON LEGEND (Right Corner)
Red Cross ➝ Environment needs fixing

DAL/QUA/AZ ➝ Installed components (Dataverse, QuAD, Azure)

Blue/Green ➝ Unmanaged vs Managed environments

📌 OBSERVATIONS
The strategy aims for code alignment, reduced duplication, and better environment hygiene.

Automation of deployment pipelines is a major goal.

Business stakeholders need to sign off on decommissioning environments like MOFF.

Multiple dev streams allow for parallelized development without bottlenecks.

Reduces cost by repurposing existing instances rather than spinning up new ones.
