Converting Power Pages Site from Trial to Production & Assigning SSL
Overview
When a Power Pages site is initially created, it runs in Trial Mode. To move it to a Production environment, certain steps must be completed, including upgrading the license, assigning a custom domain, and securing the site with an SSL certificate.

This section outlines the required steps to convert a Power Pages site from a trial to a production-ready state and ensure it is properly secured with SSL and custom domain configuration.

Step 1: Upgrade the Power Pages Site from Trial to Production
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Ensure the site moves out of trial mode for long-term use.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin / Cloud Team

Actions
Log into Power Platform Admin Center

Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center.
Click Resources in the left navigation pane.
Select Power Pages sites.
Locate the site and verify if it's in Trial Mode.
Convert to Production

Click Upgrade to Production.
Review licensing and usage.
Confirm the upgrade and wait for provisioning to complete.
Verify Production Status

Refresh the Power Pages sites list.
Confirm the site no longer shows Trial Mode.
Proceed with custom domain and SSL configuration.
Step 2: Assign a Custom Domain
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Configure a custom domain instead of the default Microsoft-provided URL.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin / Cloud Team

Actions
Log into Power Platform Admin Center

Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center.
Click Resources â†’ Power Pages Sites.
Select the Power Pages site.
Add a Custom Domain

Click Connect Custom Domain.
Enter the desired domain name (e.g., portal.example.com).
Follow the wizard and copy the CNAME record provided by Microsoft.
Update DNS Records

Access the domain registrar (e.g., Azure DNS, GoDaddy, Cloudflare).
Add a CNAME record pointing the custom domain to the Microsoft-provided URL.
Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours).
Verify Domain Mapping

Return to Power Platform Admin Center.
Click Validate Domain.
Ensure status shows Verified before proceeding.
Step 3: Upload & Assign SSL Certificate
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Secure the custom domain with an SSL certificate.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin / Cloud Team

Actions
Obtain an SSL Certificate

Purchase or generate an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA):
DigiCert, GlobalSign, Let's Encrypt, Entrust.
Export the certificate in .PFX format with a private key.
Store the SSL certificate securely (preferably in Azure Key Vault).
Upload SSL to Power Pages

Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center.
Click Resources â†’ Power Pages Sites.
Select the Power Pages site.
Click Upload SSL Certificate.
Select the .PFX certificate and enter the password.
Bind SSL to Custom Domain

Click Assign SSL Certificate.
Select the uploaded SSL certificate.
Click Bind to apply it to the custom domain.
Verify HTTPS is Active

Open the portal using the custom domain.
Ensure the site loads with HTTPS.
Use SSL Labs SSL Checker to confirm security.
Step 4: Configure Site Authentication
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Ensure Azure AD is the only active authentication method.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin

Actions
Log into Power Pages Admin Center

Navigate to Power Pages Studio.
Select the correct environment.
Click Edit on the Active Site.
Disable Local Authentication

Click Setup â†’ View Security.
Under Identity Providers, locate Local Sign-in.
Click the three dots â†’ Select Disable.
Confirm by clicking Disable in the modal pop-up.

Under Identity Providers, ensure that only Azure AD is Enabled.
If any other provider is Enabled, click the three dots and select Disable.
Verify Authentication Settings

Confirm that Azure AD is the only enabled provider.
Test user login using Azure AD credentials.
Final Checklist â€“ Post Implementation Validation
âœ… Power Pages site is upgraded to Production
âœ… Custom domain is mapped and verified
âœ… SSL certificate is uploaded and bound
âœ… Website loads securely over HTTPS
âœ… Authentication is set to Azure AD only

Troubleshooting & Common Issues
Issue	Cause	Solution
Custom domain not verified	CNAME record not propagated	Wait up to 24 hours, check with nslookup or dig
SSL certificate upload fails	Incorrect PFX format	Ensure .PFX includes a private key
Site loads without HTTPS	SSL binding incomplete	Reassign SSL in Power Pages Admin
Users unable to log in	Authentication settings incorrect	Ensure only Azure AD is enabled
Site still in trial mode	Upgrade process incomplete	Refresh and confirm upgrade in Power Platform Admin Center
Governance & Best Practices
âœ… Always use trusted SSL certificates from recognized CAs.
âœ… Store SSL certificates in Azure Key Vault for security.
âœ… Set up automated SSL renewal alerts (30 days before expiry).
âœ… Disable all unnecessary authentication methods (only Azure AD should be active).
âœ… Regularly review Power Pages custom domain & SSL configurations.

Summary
