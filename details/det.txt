Automate Scheduled Refresh of Power BI Datasets Across Data Sources

As more stakeholders depend on up-to-date data from various Power BI reports, the current manual refresh process is becoming time-consuming and unsustainable. This task aims to investigate and implement automation for refreshing the Power BI datasets that pull from multiple data sources.

Objectives:

Identify all reports and datasets currently requiring manual refresh.

Evaluate if existing Power BI service settings (e.g., Scheduled Refresh in the Power BI Service) are sufficient.

Where not sufficient, explore options such as:

Power Automate for triggering refresh

Azure Data Factory or Logic Apps for more complex orchestration

Service principals or gateway configurations (if on-prem data sources involved)

Define refresh intervals based on data sensitivity and stakeholder requirements.

Expected Outcome:

Automated, reliable dataset refresh setup with documentation.

Reduced manual effort and improved data freshness across Power BI reports.
