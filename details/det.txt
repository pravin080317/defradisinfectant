The Sales Record Management & Decision Logging feature in SVT will be implemented as a custom canvas app page embedded within the Model-Driven App, providing role-based interfaces for Caseworkers, Team Managers, and QA users. The page will use Virtual Tables or a Custom Connector to retrieve Reval Sales data from DAP2 (filtered by Outlier Flag, Job ID, and user role) and display it in searchable, filterable lists. From these lists, users can drill into a Sales Record Details screen to review linked datasets (WLTT, LRPPD, MILO, PAD), view historical decisions, and perform key actions such as changing the main source, logging verification outcomes, and raising PAD enhancement cases. All decision updates will be stored in the SV Outcome table in Dataverse for full auditability and later batch-export to DAP2. Source changes will trigger updates to PAD data via DAL1/Postgres integration. Daily system processes will export completed outcomes from Dataverse to DAP2 in batch, ensuring data integrity and alignment with downstream systems such as AVM.

Assumptions
Reval Sales data will remain in DAP2 and will not be replicated into Dataverse (only Job/Task metadata will be stored in Dataverse).

Only tasks are created in Dataverse; sales detail retrieval will always happen through the Virtual Table or Custom Connector.

Completed SV Outcomes will be exported to DAP2 once daily, not in real time.

Source data changes will not directly update DAP2 but will be reflected in PAD via DAL1/Postgres integration.

Audit trail for all user actions (decisions, reassignments, source changes) will be stored in Dataverse for compliance.

Only authorised personas (Caseworker, Manager, QA) will have access to the SVT UI, with role-based actions enforced in Power Apps.

Conditional scoring and decision logic will be handled within SVT and stored in SV Outcome.
