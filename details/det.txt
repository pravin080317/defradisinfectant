2.2 Summary & Scope of Proposed Change

The current ("As-Is") solution relies on a legacy architecture and does not meet evolving business or technical requirements. The proposed ("To-Be") change aims to modernize the solution using Microsoft Power Platform and cloud-native services to support the verification of approximately 1.5 million council property sales as part of the Welsh Council Tax Revaluation 2028 programme.

The scope of the proposed change includes:

Development of a Power Platform Canvas App (Custom Page) embedded within the existing Council Tax Case Management Model-Driven App, to support persona-driven workflows for caseworkers, managers, and QA reviewers.

Redesign of sales verification processes to allow seamless task assignment, condition scoring, verification tracking, and QA activities through the Power Platform.

Task generation and metadata storage in VaaS SQL, using stored procedures invoked via Power Automate or secure APIs.

Integration with Azure API Management, reusing the existing CT DAL (Data Access Layer) to expose PostgreSQL and VaaS SQL data to the Power Platform securely.

Deployment of SharePoint Online to manage static images and reference documents, integrated with the verification interface.

Reuse of the existing DAP platform, including Azure Data Factory and optional Databricks pipelines, to ingest and transform sales data from SDLT, WLTT, LR PPD, and MILO sources into a Master Sales Dataset.


The SVT platform will deliver a scalable, cloud-native, low-code solution designed to be reusable for future revaluation exercises and adaptable to other regions.
