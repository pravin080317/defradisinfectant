Slide 1: Technology Choices & Implementation
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Microsoft Power Pages customized with Gov.UK Design System components for accessible and consistent user experience.

Backend: Microsoft Dataverse for secure data storage and process orchestration.

Custom Logic: Implemented via Power Platform Plugins and Azure Functions for validations, file processing, and schedules management.

Integration: Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Front Door used for secure, scalable access and protection against malicious traffic.

Deployment & DevOps:

End-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps.

ARM templates and Power Platform Build Tools used to deploy solutions consistently across environments.

Maintenance Page: Custom error pages deployed for graceful handling during service outages or deployment windows.

Authentication & Data Security:

Uses Azure Entra ID (B2B) for authentication.

Adheres to least privilege access model via table permissions and role-based access control.

Files are scanned using SDES-compliant antivirus, encrypted, and stored in Azure Blob Storage.






Slide 2: Open Standards, Reuse & Risk Management
Reuse & Openness:

Follows GOV.UK open standards for frontend (design system) and backend (Azure, Dataverse).

Reuses existing Power Platform infrastructure (Dataverse, Power Pages, APIs).

Open data patterns explored where feasible (e.g., schedule publication).

Intellectual property remains within DEFRA/APHA ownership.

Tested Alternatives:

Alternatives such as SharePoint Forms, custom web apps, and Power Apps Canvas were evaluated.

Chosen stack balances configurability, extensibility, and speed to deliver within central government frameworks.

Risk Management:

Data minimisation: Only essential data (report metadata, user contact, evidence) is collected and stored.

Regular threat modelling and reviews aligned with SDES and Cyber Essentials.

Incident plans include auto-failover to maintenance mode and alerting via Azure Monitor.

Discussions held with data protection officer around secure processing and consent.

Planned Integrations:

Future roadmap includes integration with GOV.UK Notify for user alerts and status tracking.

Exploring GOV.UK Pay for any future transactions or payments.
