Here’s the rewritten Section 6.2 – Network Routing (Gateway to APIM) for the SVT LLD, aligned with your architecture and clearly stating that the existing Council Tax (CT) gateway configuration will be reused:

6.2 Network Routing – Gateway to APIM

For the Sales Verification Tool (SVT) solution, network routing between the HMRC Gateway and the Azure API Management (APIM) layer will reuse the existing Council Tax (CT) network configuration already approved and implemented within the HMRC Azure tenancy.

All TCP traffic between the Gateway and APIM will continue to be routed securely over port 443 (HTTPS).
The connection path requires acceptance and trust of the TLS certificates presented by the existing APIM instance.

As per the current configuration, all downstream communication with internal services and data sources (e.g., Azure SQL) is handled exclusively through the APIM layer — no direct routing to internal services is required.

Connections will remain restricted to port 443 via the HMRC Scrubbing Centre, and no additional inbound ports are required for SVT.
All internal API calls and Azure functions must continue to trust the APIM instance and its associated TLS certificates, as per HMRC security and DAP2 integration standards.

This approach ensures network consistency, reusability, and compliance, while minimizing new configuration overhead for the SVT deployment.

Would you like me to move next to 6.3 Network Routing – APIM to Azure SQL (to describe database access, firewall rules, and service endpoint restrictions)?
