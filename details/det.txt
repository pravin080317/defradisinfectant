Certainly. Below is a **ready-to-use documentation section** tailored specifically for the **SVT (Sales Verification Tool)** solution, focusing on **User Interface Design and Layout Approach** and **Overarching Principles / Guidelines**, considering Power Platform, Canvas Custom Pages, and Dynamics 365 standards.

## **User Interface Design and Layout Approach – SVT**

The user interface for SVT has been developed using **Power Platform’s low-code capabilities**, primarily leveraging **Canvas Custom Pages**, embedded into a Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App. The approach aims to deliver **persona-specific, intuitive, and consistent user experiences** across all internal roles involved in the sales verification process (Caseworker, Manager, Quality Control).

### Key Considerations in UI Design

* **Canvas Custom Pages** are built using **Power Apps Controls** (e.g., galleries, data cards, forms, custom components), ensuring they are **WCAG-compliant** and **responsive by default**.
* Where possible, **out-of-the-box Power Platform components** are used to streamline accessibility, support low-code maintainability, and accelerate iteration.
* UI wireframing was **skipped at the prototype stage** to rapidly deliver working screens for review, with final screen layouts to be validated and locked during **Low-Level Design (LLD)** walkthroughs.
* Each custom page aligns with a **single persona** and clearly presents only the fields and controls relevant to that persona's workflow, reducing cognitive load.

### Layout Patterns

* Each screen maintains a **left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order**, aligned to GOV.UK layout guidance and HMRC internal accessibility policies.
* **Sales verification record forms** are split into **multiple logical sections** (e.g., Banding, Sale Summary, Condition Score, LR/WLTT/MILO, QA), allowing progressive disclosure of data while maintaining structure.
* Pages with a high number of data sections (e.g., View Sales Record) include **scrolling**, but maintain consistent padding, headings, and landmark ARIA roles for screen readers.
* **Submit, Assign, and Promote actions** are consistently placed at the **bottom-right** of the form or section, aligned to user action flow.

## **Overarching Principles / Guidelines – SVT UI**

The following overarching principles were adopted in the design and build of SVT:

| Principle                     | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity over Complexity**   | Each screen is designed to show only what the user needs. Complex interactions (like "Promote to Master") are visually isolated and contextual.                  |
| **Persona-driven Screens**    | All screens and controls are built for a specific role (Caseworker, Manager, or QC), reducing cross-persona confusion and avoiding permission-related UX issues. |
| **No Acronyms in UI**         | User-facing text avoids internal abbreviations (e.g., “Useful Sale” instead of “USF”), aligning with GOV.UK content style guidelines.                            |
| **Consistent Navigation**     | Menu entries, dashboards, and views follow a consistent naming convention and layout order. Canvas pages and embedded views reuse common header/footer patterns. |
| **Reusable Components**       | Where needed, PCF components or shared Canvas components are used (e.g., condition scoring, badge displays) to maintain design consistency.                      |
| **Color and Accessibility**   | All buttons, charts, and alerts adhere to VOA color branding and WCAG 2.2 contrast standards. Focus states and keyboard navigation are tested during UAT.        |
| **Minimal Training Required** | UI is designed such that users can perform verification, assignment, and QA actions without requiring extensive documentation or training.                       |
| **Mobile Support (Optional)** | While optimized for desktop, all Canvas Custom Pages are **responsive** and can technically run on tablets or mobile devices for secondary scenarios.            |
