Security Roles Mapping for LA Portal

Out of the five SRS roles defined for the LA Portal, only the following three roles require Dynamics Security Roles mapping, as these roles are intended for internal users who need backend access (Dataverse):

VOA Portal Admin – Provides administrative access to manage both the portal and backend data.
VOA Portal Page Admin – Manages configurations and content of the portal pages.
VOA Portal Viewer – Read-only access for internal users to view backend data.
The remaining two SRS roles listed below do not require Dynamics Security Roles as they are intended exclusively for external users interacting directly with the portal:

VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod – Read-only access for external users (no backend Dataverse access).
VOA Portal Only Admin Prod – Admin-level portal access for external users managing portal submissions (no backend Dataverse access).
All external user requests and submissions are managed through these two roles. Only select internal users are assigned the three Dynamics-backed roles mentioned above to accommodate future enhancements, internal processes, onboarding, and related functionalities.
