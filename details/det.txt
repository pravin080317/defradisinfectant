Step 2: Power Pages Site Installation and Activation
Why is this step necessary?
After an environment reset, the Power Pages site (portal) needs to be reinstalled and activated to restore access for external users. Since Power Pages is based on the Customer Service template of Dynamics 365, a fresh installation ensures proper linkage with Dataverse and backend configurations.

Additionally, when a new Power Pages site is created, an App Registration is automatically generated in Microsoft Entra ID. This app registration will later need to be configured as part of the next step (TEN Document Update), but for now, the focus is on site activation.
