Topic: Portal Validation & Legacy System Differences
Web Roles & Portal User Setup:

There was a mention of issues related to web roles in the LA Portal.
The process for setting up portal users was discussed.
BRF (Billing Reference Field) Validation Issue:

In legacy systems, it's possible to create records without a BRF.
In the LA Portal (Single Report journey), BRF is mandatory.
Current issue: BRF is uneditable in the portal, leading to validation errors but no option to correct the field.
The reason for BRF being uneditable is due to the initial design assumptions (address validation happens in Front Door, and modifying BRF could bring mismatches).
Proposal:
Allow BRF to be editable when a validation error occurs (e.g., blank BRF).
Emma's approval is needed before making this change.
Interim solution:
Reference data will mark this BRF validation as “not required” temporarily, so blank BRF submissions will be auto-submitted instead of being flagged in "Fix Errors."
BA Reference and Report Number Differences:

BA Report:
Alphanumeric, 25-character limit, currently truncated at 100 characters before saving.
BA Reference:
Should also be truncated if over 25 characters (currently stuck in "Fix Errors" if >100).
BA Reference number validation differs between legacy and portal (legacy might reject alphanumeric while portal accepts it).
This is a design conflict that needs business clarification.
UPRN Handling:

UPRN is optional in the portal journey but has some validations.
Proposal:
Treat UPRN validation similarly to BRF and BA Reference.
Ensure validation and truncation logic is consistent across fields.
Portal Exception Reasons Table:

This is a portal-specific reference data table that controls validation display logic on the portal.
Contains flags like "Required" or "Not Required" for each validation rule.
Changing this table can suppress validations on the portal frontend.
The table is sourced from the Master Reference Data.
Process for Reference Data Updates:

A JIRA ticket should be raised for the reference data change.
Once approved, the records will be updated in the Master Reference by designated teams (e.g., Anand).
This data then flows down to all environments (DEV, UAT, SIT, etc.).
Changes will also need to be manually added to PROD via a hotfix until the automated pipeline catches up in the next release.
A hotfix RFC will be raised for production (ServiceNow & Jira linked).
Release Considerations:

Any temporary changes applied in PROD via hotfix must be incorporated into the Master Ref to prevent them from being overwritten by subsequent releases (e.g., 1.1).
If needed, this hotfix can be handled as a post-deployment step in lower environments.
Notes:
The conversation touches on improving data quality by enforcing proper validations and providing users the ability to fix key fields like BRF and BA Reference numbers.
There’s a mix of immediate hotfix requirements and longer-term systemic fixes.
