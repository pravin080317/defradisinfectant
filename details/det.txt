Certainly. Here's the revised response, combining your points 4 and 5 into a complete and clear answer for **Question 3**:

---

### **3. Does the Front Door validate or reconcile uploaded address data (e.g., for LA–VOA postcode mismatches)?**

* **No automatic reconciliation or validation occurs** between Local Authority (LA) and VOA data at the upload stage.
* **Front Door does not correct or pre-identify addresses** from uploaded data.
* If address lookup fails, the system:

  * **Still creates** a *Portal Request Submission* and a *Request* using the **original user-provided address**.
  * **Does not map the address to a hereditament** automatically.
* **During case processing**, users must **manually match the address to the correct hereditament** (VOA property).
* Without this manual selection, **the process cannot proceed further**.

Let me know if you'd like this formatted for a stakeholder report or response deck.



1. What data source does the portal validate against — VOA or Royal Mail?
Answer: The portal currently uses the Gazetteer Ordnance Survey Address Lookup API, which is believed to be an internal endpoint.

Action: It needs confirmation with the DAW (Data & Address Warehouse) team to be sure of the exact backing data source behind the API.

Note: It does not use Royal Mail PAF.

2. What happens if a postcode fails validation in the new portal?
If the postcode/address match fails, the system:

Marks the record as “Address Match Failed”.

Still proceeds to create the Portal Request Submission and Request.

However, user must manually select the hereditament (VOA property/address) later in the case journey to continue processing.
