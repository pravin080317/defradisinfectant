Title:
Access Request: Permissions to View la-reports Folder in bstiazstprdreports Storage Container (PROD)

Description:
Requesting access to the la-reports container located in the bstiazstprdreports storage account in the PROD environment.

When attempting to access the container, the following error is encountered:

“You do not have permissions to use the access key to list data.”

We require this access to view and verify files in the schedules folder under this container as part of post-deployment validation and operational monitoring.

Please grant appropriate RBAC/role permissions or provide alternate access guidance.

Let me know if you want to add the object ID or subscription/resource group details from the error for clarity.
