Topic 1: Security Role Mapping (SRS Roles to Dataverse Security Roles)
Explain briefly:

Only 3 out of 5 existing SRS roles require mapping to Dynamics Security Roles (VOA Portal Admin, VOA Portal Page Admin, VOA Portal Viewer).
Remaining two roles (VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod, VOA Portal Only Admin Prod) are portal-only, require no Dataverse access, and currently handle all external user interactions.
Highlight that internal user access will depend on these 3 roles for future functionalities like onboarding, internal processes, etc.
Discuss next steps clearly:

Confirm the creation of three new Dataverse security roles to map these SRS roles.
Agree on role naming conventions, e.g.,
VOA Portal Administrator
VOA Portal Page Administrator
VOA Portal Internal Viewer
Clarify testing in DEV, and later including them in the case management pipeline.
Topic 2: Performance Analyst Role Requirements (Andrew McNeil)
Clearly split into two-day approach:

Day 1 – Immediate Approach (short-term solution)

Confirm that Andrew currently has the "VOA-BST Programme Read Only User" role in SIT.
Verify with Andrew that he can successfully query data.
Once confirmed, clarify who will grant this existing role in PROD.
Day 2 – Future Approach (long-term solution)

Consider creating a dedicated SRS role for Performance Analysts.
Confirm if existing roles like "VOA-BST Programme Read Only User" can be reused or if a new dedicated role is needed.
Explore use of Azure Application Insights as part of a future enhancement to track detailed user activity.
Suggested Meeting Flow:
Clearly introduce both topics.
Get confirmation on the immediate tasks for Topic 1 (security roles).
Transition smoothly into Topic 2, starting with immediate access requirement for Andrew.
Clarify Day 1 immediate action points clearly.
Then discuss Day 2 approach for long-term enhancement clearly mentioning Azure Application Insights.
Be prepared to clarify or discuss:
Why only 3 roles need Dataverse security roles.
Implications of reusing existing roles vs. creating new roles.
Timeline and ownership clarity for Day 1 access in PROD.
Clarification on expectations around Azure Application Insights for Day 2.
This structure ensures clarity and sets distinct next steps, helping keep the discussion on track and productive.
