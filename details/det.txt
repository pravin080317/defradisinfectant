Based on the SVT features you‚Äôve shared, here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of **personas** and the **automatic vs manual task assignment logic** across the Sales Verification Tool (SVT):

## üîÑ **Task Assignment Types**

| Task Assignment Type                    | Description                                                                              | Triggered By                | Assigned To                                    |

| ‚úÖ **Automatic**                         | For *Outlier* flagged records, a scheduled flow automatically creates a Task in Dynamics | Power Automate flow (daily) | Task assigned to Team Queue or left Unassigned |
| ‚úã **Manual (Manager)**                  | Team Manager manually creates Tasks or reassigns from the dashboard                      | Team Manager via UI         | Specific Caseworker                            |

## üéØ Task ID Linking

* Every **Reval Sale Record** that requires verification has a **linked `TaskId`** (stored in DAP2, pointing to a Dynamics task).
* This `TaskId` allows the canvas app (SVT custom page) to:

  * Show task status, owner, title
  * Filter and track sales via assigned jobs
  * Navigate to the related Dataverse task record

---

## üìå Summary of Assignment Logic

* **Service Account** handles *daily ingestion and automatic task creation* for outliers.
* **Team Manager** handles *task assignment*, *job creation*, *bulk allocation*, and *overrides*.
* **Caseworkers** receive *assigned jobs* and cannot self-assign.
* **QA Reviewer** can return *failed* verifications for reassignment.
