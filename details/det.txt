Here’s the rewritten version of Section 6.1 – Network Routing (Power Platform to Gateway), updated for the SVT solution which will reuse the existing Council Tax (CT) environment and network routing configuration — keeping the HMRC infrastructure language consistent and LLD-ready:

6.1 Network Routing – Power Platform to Gateway

The Sales Verification Tool (SVT) solution leverages the existing Council Tax (CT) Power Platform environment and associated network routing configuration already established under the HMRC Azure tenancy.

The Dynamics 365 / Power Platform components are deployed as SaaS services, and all network communication between the Power Platform and internal Azure or API components is routed securely through the HMRC Scrubbing Centre Reverse Proxy.

The Power Platform infrastructure will communicate via the existing root gateway endpoint:

https://voagw.prod.hmrc.gov.uk

This endpoint is a publicly resolvable DNS entry configured to present one of the Root CA Certificates as per Microsoft’s Server Cipher Suites and TLS Requirements for Power Platform documentation.

The external endpoint must continue to accept requests from Azure Service Tag IP ranges associated with the following service tags and regions:

PowerPlatformInfra.UKSouth

PowerPlatformInfra.UKWest

PowerPlatformPlex.UKSouth

PowerPlatformPlex.UKWest


As SVT resides within the existing CT tenant infrastructure, all routing configurations, proxy rules, and certificates already implemented for CT workloads will be reused without change.
No new network routes or gateways are required for SVT; the solution will use the shared gateway and routing paths validated for other valuation and DAP2-integrated workloads.
