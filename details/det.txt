Service Architecture Overview

The Local Authority Portal is built using Microsoft Power Pages and integrates with Dataverse as the backend storage and workflow engine. The user interface is designed with the GOV.UK Design System, ensuring accessibility and compliance with government standards. Authentication follows a secure Azure B2B model, leveraging Azure Entra ID for identity and access management. Key functionalities include file uploads, address search, schedules listing, and report submissions, all managed through Dataverse API. The solution employs custom plugins for enhanced processing, such as validation and linking of uploaded files to cases, as well as dynamic data retrieval for address searches.

To support scalable processing, the system integrates with Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions for handling file uploads, file processing, and schedule management. Uploaded files undergo validation, antivirus scanning, and formatting checks before being stored in Azure Blob Storage. Schedule data retrieval and downloads are facilitated through API endpoints, ensuring real-time availability and efficient data access. This architecture ensures a robust, cloud-native, and scalable solution for local authorities to interact seamlessly with the system while maintaining data integrity and security.

Evidence file uploads follow a structured and secure workflow. When users submit evidence files through the portal, a Dataverse plugin is triggered, which sends the file to the SDES system for virus scanning. Once the SDES validation and security checks are completed, the file is transferred to Azure Blob Storage for temporary holding. The Azure API Management (APIM) and Front Door-enabled Azure Functions then pick up the file, process it, and send it to SharePoint for long-term storage.

The status of the uploaded evidence is updated in Dataverse, ensuring that users can track the progress of their submissions through the portal. This automated pipeline enhances security, maintains compliance, and provides a seamless user experience. The combination of Power Pages, Dataverse, SharePoint, Azure Storage, and Azure Functions enables a streamlined, scalable, and secure document management process within the Local Authority Portal.
