### Meeting Notes: IP Restrictions for Lower Environments

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Time:** [Insert Time]  
**Attendees:** [List of Attendees]  
**Subject:** IP Restrictions for Lower Environments

---

#### **Background:**
- Initially, environments were set up without any authentication, making them open to access.
- To mitigate risks, IP restrictions were implemented to limit access to only internal users.
- Over time, B2B authentication was introduced across all environments, including production.
- Production environments no longer have IP restrictions as they need to be publicly accessible.
- Lower environments (non-production) previously had IP restrictions, but these were forgotten during a reset and remediation process.
- The question now is whether IP restrictions are still necessary for lower environments, given that B2B authentication is in place.

---

#### **Key Points Discussed:**
1. **Current State:**
   - All environments now have B2B authentication.
   - Production environments are publicly accessible without IP restrictions.
   - Lower environments previously had IP restrictions, but these were not reapplied after a reset.

2. **Security Considerations:**
   - HMRC places a high priority on security, and IP restrictions were initially implemented as part of the security measures.
   - With B2B authentication now in place, the need for IP restrictions is debatable.
   - However, removing IP restrictions might raise questions during audits or reviews, as they were part of the original security setup.

3. **Operational Considerations:**
   - Adding IP restrictions introduces additional complexity:
     - Identifying and maintaining the list of IP addresses to block.
     - Potential troubleshooting challenges, such as determining whether access issues are due to IP restrictions, firewalls, or other factors.
   - Lower environments are not publicly accessible like production, so the risk of unauthorized access is lower.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Risk of Removing IP Restrictions:**
     - Potential security gaps, though mitigated by B2B authentication.
     - Possible scrutiny during audits or compliance checks.
   - **Risk of Keeping IP Restrictions:**
     - Increased operational overhead.
     - Potential delays in troubleshooting and access issues.

#### **Decisions to Take:**
1. **Do we need to reapply IP restrictions for lower environments?**
   - **Option 1:** Keep IP restrictions for lower environments to align with original security documentation and reduce potential risks.
   - **Option 2:** Remove IP restrictions for lower environments, relying on B2B authentication as the primary security measure.

2. **If we decide to keep IP restrictions:**
   - Work with the network team to reapply the restrictions.
   - Ensure the list of IP addresses to block is up-to-date and manageable.
   - Document the decision and rationale for future reference.

3. **If we decide to remove IP restrictions:**
   - Ensure that B2B authentication is robust and sufficient to secure lower environments.
   - Update security documentation to reflect the change and justify the decision based on the current security measures.

---

#### **Action Items:**
1. **Security Team:**
   - Provide a recommendation on whether IP restrictions are still necessary for lower environments, considering the current security setup.
   - Assess the risks of removing IP restrictions and provide a risk mitigation plan if necessary.

2. **Network Team:**
   - If IP restrictions are to be reapplied, work on implementing them based on the existing sample or template.
   - Ensure that the IP restriction list is accurate and does not disrupt access for authorized users.

3. **Project Team:**
   - Document the final decision and rationale for future reference.
   - Communicate the decision to all relevant stakeholders.

---

#### **Next Steps:**
- Schedule a follow-up meeting to finalize the decision.
- Ensure all action items are assigned and timelines are set.
- Review the decision with higher management if necessary.

### **Discussion Points for the Call:**
1. **Security Team's Recommendation:**
   - What is the security team's stance on the necessity of IP restrictions for lower environments?
   - Are there any specific risks or compliance requirements that necessitate keeping IP restrictions?

2. **Operational Impact:**
   - How will reapplying IP restrictions impact day-to-day operations, especially in terms of troubleshooting and access management?
   - Are there any potential conflicts with existing firewalls or network configurations?

3. **Documentation and Compliance:**
   - How should the decision be documented to ensure compliance with HMRC's security policies?
   - What changes need to be made to the existing security documentation?

4. **Timeline and Implementation:**
   - If IP restrictions are to be reapplied, what is the estimated timeline for implementation?
   - Who will be responsible for maintaining the IP restriction list moving forward?
