1. Phase Readiness and Milestones
Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live Phases: GDS requires that teams validate they’ve met specific exit criteria at each phase. Make sure you have sign-off steps to progress from Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live.

Beta Labelling: If you’re publicly testing, the service should be labeled as “Beta” so users know it might change.

2. Cost, Governance, and Spend Controls
Cost per Transaction: GDS specifically tracks cost per transaction as a KPI for service efficiency. If this is relevant, make sure you’ve got a plan to measure and report it.

Spend Approvals: Certain government services need Cabinet Office or departmental spend approvals. It may not always apply, but it’s worth confirming if your project is subject to this.

3. Operational and Business Continuity
Incident Management / Disaster Recovery: Have a documented plan for service outages or major incidents, including fallback approaches for users.

Business Continuity: If the digital channel is down, how do users continue or complete the process (especially if it’s critical, e.g., tax filing)?

4. Data Lifecycle, Retention, and Archiving
Data Minimization / Retention: GDS and HMRC guidelines encourage collecting only what’s strictly necessary. Confirm there’s a documented retention period and data disposal/archiving strategy (especially for personal data).

Data Transfer: If user data moves between systems (internal or third-party), ensure you have documented flows, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA), and a clear legal basis for processing.

5. Cookie Policy and Consent
Cookies and Tracking: Ensure you have a clear cookie policy that meets GDPR/PECR. Users should understand (and consent to) how their data is tracked.

Cookie Banner: Typically required for public services (unless strictly exempt). Even if minimal analytics are used, GDS expects transparency.

6. Open Source and Reusability
Open Source: GDS strongly encourages making source code open if possible (especially generic components) – unless there are good security or commercial reasons not to.

Common Components: Verify if you can use or contribute to open standards and existing GOV.UK design system elements (e.g., form patterns, headings, and icons).

7. Policy and Regulatory Alignment
Compliance with Departmental Policy: For HMRC, ensure relevant policy owners and governance boards have signed off. This includes any official disclaimers, specific guidance text, or compliance statements.

Equality Impact Assessment: Formal documentation to demonstrate you’ve considered equality obligations under the Equality Act (especially in how the service is designed and tested with different user groups).

8. Service Naming and Branding
Service Name: GOV.UK services often follow a standardized naming approach (e.g., “Apply for [X]” or “Check [Y]”). If your service is part of HMRC’s portfolio, confirm it adheres to naming guidelines so users recognize it as official.

Domain and URL: For public services, GDS typically advises using a gov.uk domain or a subdomain (if it’s an official government service). Make sure you’re using an approved domain (and brand) if applicable.

9. Further User Support and Communication
Help and Complaints Mechanism: GDS emphasizes a clear route for users to get help or escalate issues. This goes beyond “support tickets” – it might include phone lines, chat, or other assisted digital.

Public Comms / Onboarding: Especially if you’re migrating existing users from a legacy service. Plan how you’ll communicate changes or new features to them.

10. Future Iteration Plan
Post-Live Improvement: GDS is big on continual iteration. It’s good to formalize how you’ll keep measuring, testing with real users, and rolling out improvements (technical, content, or policy changes).

Retrospectives: A structured approach to gather lessons learned at intervals to feed back into the backlog.
