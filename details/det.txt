Call Discussion Agenda & Key Points
📅 Meeting Date: Tomorrow
🎯 Objective: Discuss testing approach for 3 new security roles & support devs’ access to prod logs during go-live

Discussion Topics
1️⃣ Testing Approach for 3 New Security Roles
Background:
Issue in DEV:

Only one Teams group is connected to D365 DEV SRS Role.
New Azure AD Security Groups & SRS roles are not appearing in search for DEV & FAT.
Current Configuration in FAT:

Azure AD security groups are added in FAT.
SRS roles like:
VOA Portal Admin (Non-Prod)
VOA Portal Page Admin (Non-Prod)
VOA Portal Viewer (Non-Prod)
However, these roles are not appearing in search.
Points for Discussion:
✅ How should testing be approached?

Option 1: Test in SIT (if roles appear correctly).
Option 2: Directly add users in DEV & manually assign the roles for testing feasibility.
✅ Confirm if users can be manually added in DEV for testing purposes.

If so, assign roles and conduct tests.
If not, explore alternative environments.
✅ Determine dependencies for testing.

Any additional security settings, permissions, or sync issues impacting DEV?
✅ Final Decision on where to test the 3 roles before moving to UAT.

2️⃣ Support Devs’ Access to Prod During Go-Live
Background:
Challenge:
Support developers do not have any security role allowing access to Dataverse logs, plugin traces, etc. in PROD.
This may block troubleshooting & monitoring during go-live.
Proposed Solutions:
✅ How can support devs get permission to access PROD logs?

Can they be assigned a temporary security role?
Alternative: Use VOA Portal Admin role for support devs only during go-live?
✅ Define who will have access to plugin trace logs, Dataverse logs, and Power Pages logs during go-live.

Will business users manage logs, or should support devs be temporarily assigned a specific role?
✅ Set permissions based on user role classifications:

VOA Portal Admin (Prod): For support developers (monitoring & troubleshooting).
VOA Portal Page Admin (Prod): For internal users (managing Power Pages).
VOA Portal Viewer (Prod): For internal business users onboarding & enhancements.
Expected Outcomes from the Call
🔹 Finalize the testing plan for the 3 new roles.
🔹 Confirm whether users can be added manually in DEV for testing or if another approach is required.
🔹 Determine how support devs will access logs in PROD during go-live.
🔹 Align on role assignments for internal business users and support teams.

Next Steps Post-Discussion
📌 Testing Plan Finalization
📌 User Assignment Updates for DEV, FAT, and SIT
📌 Security Role Mapping Updates for Support & Business Users
📌 Prepare Go-Live Support Access Plan for PROD
