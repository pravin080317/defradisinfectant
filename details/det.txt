üîç Notes:

These virtual tables are custom data providers using Azure API Management + DAL API and registered using the Custom Virtual Table Provider pattern in Dataverse.

Where applicable, canvas pages bind directly to these tables for read, while state changes (like promote, status update) are routed through custom APIs or Power Automate flows.

Most are read-only from the external source, except for status tracking or workflow progression tables (jobstatus, verificationstatus).
