Power Pages SSL Certificate Management Runbook
This runbook provides a structured process to manage SSL certificates for Power Pages securely and effectively.

1. SSL Certificate Request & Procurement
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Obtain a valid SSL certificate for Power Pages.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Cloud Team / Security Team

Steps:
Determine Domain Name:

Identify the custom domain (e.g., portal.example.com).
Ensure the CNAME record is set up in DNS before SSL procurement.
Request SSL Certificate:

Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) (e.g., DigiCert, GlobalSign, Entrust, Let's Encrypt).
Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submit it to the CA.
Obtain the issued certificate in PFX format with a private key.
Store SSL Securely in Azure Key Vault (Recommended):

Upload the SSL certificate (.PFX) to Azure Key Vault.
Assign appropriate access permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
2. Mapping Custom Domain to Power Pages
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Configure the custom domain before applying the SSL certificate.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin / Cloud Team

Steps:
Access Power Platform Admin Center:

Navigate to Power Pages â†’ Custom Domains.
Click Add Custom Domain.
Update DNS Configuration:

Obtain the CNAME record provided by Microsoft.
Update your DNS provider with this CNAME record.
Verify DNS Propagation:

Use tools like nslookup, dig, or WhatsMyDNS to confirm propagation.
Confirm Custom Domain Mapping:

Return to Power Platform Admin Center and ensure the domain is verified.
3. Upload & Apply SSL Certificate to Power Pages
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Secure Power Pages with the obtained SSL certificate.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Power Pages Admin / Cloud Team

Steps:
Prepare the SSL Certificate:

Ensure the certificate is in PFX format.
Keep the password for the PFX file securely stored.
Upload SSL to Power Pages:

Go to Power Platform Admin Center â†’ Power Pages.
Navigate to SSL Certificates â†’ Upload SSL Certificate.
Select the .PFX file and enter the password.
Assign SSL to Custom Domain:

Go to Custom Domains â†’ Select your domain.
Choose the uploaded SSL certificate and apply it.
4. SSL Certificate Expiry Monitoring & Renewal
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Ensure the SSL certificate is renewed before expiry to prevent downtime.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Security Team / Cloud Team

Steps:
Monitor Expiry Date:

Track SSL certificate expiry using:
Power Platform Admin Center (Check SSL section)
Azure Key Vault (If SSL is stored there)
Third-party monitoring tools (SSL Labs, DigiCert CertCentral)
Renew SSL Certificate:

30-45 days before expiry, initiate renewal with the CA.
Follow the SSL procurement steps to get a new certificate.
Replace Expired SSL Certificate:

Upload the renewed PFX certificate to Power Pages SSL settings.
Reassign it to the custom domain.
Verify HTTPS connection after applying.
5. Post-Implementation Security Checks & Cleanup
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Ensure security best practices and remove outdated configurations.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Security Team / Power Pages Admin

Steps:
Validate SSL Installation:

Test the HTTPS connection using:
Browser Console (Check SSL validity)
SSL Labs SSL Checker
Remove Old SSL Certificates:

Delete expired certificates from:
Power Platform Admin Center
Azure Key Vault (If stored there)
Ensure Secure Transfer of SSL Certificates:

Certificates should never be stored in Git repositories.
Use Azure Key Vault or an encrypted file transfer method.
Audit & Log SSL Changes:

Document SSL installation, renewal, and expiration dates.
Maintain an SSL Management Runbook for future reference.
6. Incident Handling: SSL Certificate Issues
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Address potential SSL-related issues affecting Power Pages.
ðŸ”¹ Responsible Team: Cloud Team / Security Team

Common Issues & Solutions
Issue	Cause	Solution
SSL Certificate Not Valid	DNS not fully propagated	Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours), check with nslookup or dig.
Certificate Not Secure	Incorrect SSL binding	Ensure SSL is assigned to the correct domain in Power Pages.
SSL Expired	Certificate not renewed	Renew certificate before expiry and update it in Power Pages.
Mixed Content Errors	HTTP elements still loading	Ensure all resources (images, scripts, APIs) use HTTPS.
SSL Not Loading	Incorrect .PFX format	Verify correct PFX format & password before upload.
7. Governance & Best Practices
âœ… Never store SSL certificates in Git repositories.
âœ… Use Azure Key Vault to store and manage SSL certificates.
âœ… Enable role-based access control (RBAC) for SSL certificates.
âœ… Automate SSL monitoring using Azure Monitor or third-party tools.
âœ… Set up renewal alerts at least 30 days before expiry.
âœ… Conduct regular security audits to check for SSL vulnerabilities.
