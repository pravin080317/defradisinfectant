Following our discussion, please find below the key points and agreements captured regarding SRS Role and Dataverse Security Role Mapping for the LA Portal.

Current Status
We have five existing SRS roles for the LA Portal, categorized based on whether they require a Dynamics license:

SRS Role	Dynamics License Required	Notes
VOA Portal Admin	✅ Yes	Admin for portal and backend
VOA Portal Page Admin	✅ Yes	Manages Power Pages
VOA Portal Viewer	✅ Yes	Read-only access for internal users
VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod	❌ No	Read-only portal access, no Dataverse access
VOA Portal Only Admin Prod	❌ No	Portal admin, no Dataverse access
Clarification:
The two external roles (VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod & VOA Portal Only Admin Prod) are for external users accessing the portal and do not require Dataverse access.
The three internal roles (VOA Portal Admin, VOA Portal Page Admin, VOA Portal Viewer) are designed for future functionalities like user onboarding, internal process automation, and advanced portal management.
Current Action Items
Security role mapping analysis for the three internal roles has been completed.
Three new Dataverse security roles are being created, configured, and tested in the DEV environment:
VOA Portal Administrator – Future role for an individual who can administer the LA Portal (e.g., approve new users, manage portal settings).
VOA Portal Page Administrator – Manages portal content without full administrative access.
VOA Portal Internal Viewer – Read-only access for internal users.
Post DEV validation, testing and pipeline updates will follow for the next release cycle.
Decision & Next Steps (Agreed by All)
✅ Day 1 (Go-Live) Impact:

These three internal SRS roles and their security role mappings are not critical for immediate Go-Live.
Agreed to treat this as a Day 2 activity and implement after review, approval, and thorough testing.
✅ Temporary Support Plan:

Until these roles are finalized and deployed, any internal administrative support requirements will be temporarily handled through ECS or appropriate system admin channels.
Next Meeting & Follow-ups:
Once the DEV testing is completed, we will revisit this plan and confirm the next steps for implementation.
Any changes or refinements required for the new roles will be reviewed before moving to higher environments.
Please let me know if I missed anything or if there are any further clarifications required.
