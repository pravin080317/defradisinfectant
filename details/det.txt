We have logged a bug to investigate the issue reported by Ealing Council (Ref: LA Portal – Ealing Council BA 5270). The issue relates to a multiple-report XML file containing 274 BA reports, which has been stuck in processing since 19-Aug-25. A reattempt on 20-Aug-25 also failed. This was initially shared by Stuart via email.

In today’s call with Michael, we confirmed that the problem occurs only in the production environment—the same file processes successfully in lower environments. The root cause is still unknown, but we have identified areas in the front-door code where additional logging will be added. These logs should help us pinpoint the exact reason for the failure.

Please check and mark the PO signed on this bug. This will be treated as a high-priority bug, and we will work closely with Michael on the resolution. We may also require support from users as part of this investigation.
