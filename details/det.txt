GDS Assessment - Questions & Responses Summary for LA Portal

1. Authentication & Authorization

Q: How does Entra ID B2B authentication work? Is Government Gateway used?
A: No, Government Gateway is not used. Entra ID B2B allows external users (e.g., Local Authority staff) to authenticate via their own organisation's identity provider. HMRC manages the Entra ID tenant. Only invited users can log in, and authentication is followed by authorization via Power Pages web roles and Dataverse table permissions.

Q: How is authorization managed?
A: Power Pages uses web roles tied to Dataverse table permissions. Web roles define read/write/upload access per user and are assigned post-authentication through Power Automate flows.

Pending: Formal process to maintain a list of council-approved lead contacts (approvers) is not automated yet.

2. User Onboarding & Role Management

Q: How are new users onboarded and who approves them?
A: Currently manual. Product Owners receive user requests only from known council leads and raise guest access requests. Web roles are then assigned using a semi-automated workflow. There is a future plan to build a UI for lead users to manage this process directly.

Pending:

Need formal tracking of council lead approvers.

Consider building a lead user portal page post-public beta.

3. Third-Party Access (e.g., KPMG)

Q: How is third-party access validated?
A: Product Owners provide a validated list. If a council wants to revoke access, they notify HMRC service team, who manually remove the user. This will be governed via ISRS roles in future.

4. File Upload, Validation & Feedback Flow

Q: How are validation errors handled and displayed?
A: Files are virus-scanned via SDES, then stored in Azure Blob Storage. Azure Functions validate files and write metadata + validation results into Dataverse. Power Pages displays status, errors, and allows users to fix metadata inline or re-upload.

Q: Are partial errors handled?
A: Yes. Record-level errors are stored in Dataverse. Users can fix metadata for specific records or re-upload the entire file.

5. Data Retention Policies

Q: What are the data retention timelines for Blob, Dataverse, and SDES?
A:

Azure Blob: Housekeeping scripts under consideration; preliminary retention target = 6 years.

Dataverse: Retention period not yet finalised.

SDES: Temporary holding only; files auto-deleted after configured time window.

Pending: Need confirmation from business/POs on formal retention policies per system.

6. Penetration Testing

Q: Has a pen test been completed?
A: Yes. A test was done in October/November 2023 for private beta. One low-priority issue was found and fixed.

Pending: Confirm if this test also covers public beta or if a new test is planned.

7. Feature Enhancements from Private to Public Beta

Q: What changes were made between private and public beta?
A:

Accessibility fixes.

Bug fixes based on user feedback.

New feature: Multiple council switching for users (primarily third-party agents like KPMG).

8. Open Source, Standards & Compliance

Q: Is the code open source? Are standards being followed?
A: Yes. Frontend custom code (HTML/JS/CSS) is based on GOV.UK Design System. RESTful APIs follow OpenAPI standards. Components and styling are reused from open-source libraries.

9. Platform Selection Justification

Q: Why was Power Platform chosen over MDTP?
A:

Seamless integration with Dynamics (BST core).

Faster delivery using low-code/no-code tools.

Reduced cost and reuse of existing SaaS infrastructure.

SAD platform used by other internal teams.

10. Monitoring & Logging

Q: How is the service monitored?
A: Azure Application Insights is enabled on Power Pages and custom Azure Functions. A performance analyst is working on Power BI dashboards for tracking usage, errors, and telemetry.

11. Disaster Recovery & Availability

Q: What happens if the service is unavailable?
A:

Maintenance page configured via Azure Front Door.

CI/CD pipelines can redeploy to any environment.

Monitoring/alerts in place for rapid triage.
