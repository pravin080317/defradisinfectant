Our commitment to accessibility
We are committed to making our [Service Name] accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We aim to fully meet or exceed the accessibility standards outlined in WCAG 2.1 AA (and we are also working towards aligning with WCAG 2.2 requirements).

Scope of this statement
This statement applies to the [Service Name] website ([include URL/link to your service**]). It does not apply to any linked external websites that are not provided by us.

How accessible this service is
We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

Some links and buttons do not have the correct programmatic attributes (e.g., href attributes may be missing).

Certain headings and form elements lack proper semantic structure (<fieldset> without <legend>, error messages not associated with inputs, etc.).

PDF documents (such as the schedules calendar) may not be fully accessible to screen reader users.

Dynamic changes to the page are not always announced to screen readers, which may cause confusion.

Date validation and address lookup functionality may pose barriers for those relying on assistive technology or keyboard-only navigation.

Technical information about this website’s accessibility
[Service Name] is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is currently partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard due to the non-compliances listed below.

Non-accessible content
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:

Links without href attributes (WCAG 2.1 criterion 2.4.4):

Some links or interactive elements do not have the correct href or role attributes. This means keyboard and screen reader users may not be able to use them effectively.

Incorrect or missing form associations (WCAG 2.1 criterion 3.3.2):

Some form fields do not have associated labels or error messages, making it difficult for screen reader users to understand which field is incorrect.

Headings and semantic structure (WCAG 2.1 criterion 1.3.1):

A few pages lack properly nested headings, affecting how screen readers parse the page hierarchy.

PDF documents (WCAG 2.1 criterion 1.1.1, 1.3.1):

Some PDFs (e.g., our schedules calendar) are not tagged correctly and may not be fully accessible to screen reader users.

Dynamic changes not announced (WCAG 2.1 criterion 4.1.3):

Some interactive components do not provide alerts or region announcements for dynamic changes, which may confuse screen reader users.

Non-compliance with WCAG 2.2
We are also aware of additional WCAG 2.2-level issues, such as:

Date validation and address lookup challenges (WCAG 2.2 level AA).

We are in the process of addressing these to ensure that we meet (or exceed) 2.1 AA and are ready for 2.2 as soon as it’s fully adopted in regulations.

Disproportionate burden
At this time, we have not assessed any of our current issues as a disproportionate burden. We are actively working to resolve these issues to ensure users have the best possible experience.

Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
Third-party content: Some external links or embedded media may be outside of our control if they are not created or funded by us. We will do our best to work with third-party providers to improve accessibility where possible.

How we tested this service
This service was last tested on [date]. The test was carried out internally by [Your Team or Department], using:

Manual testing with keyboard-only navigation and screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

Automated testing tools (e.g., Axe, Wave, or other).

We tested all main user journeys, especially critical tasks like submitting forms, uploading documents, and reading PDFs.

What we’re doing to improve accessibility
We are currently fixing the issues listed above in a staged approach:

Fixing critical Level A issues (links without href, incorrect form labeling, page title, and heading structures) by [target date].

Addressing Level AA issues (date validation, address lookup, form instructions) by [target date].

Revising PDF documents to ensure they are fully accessible or providing HTML alternatives where possible, ongoing by [target date].

Once these changes are made, we will re-test the website and update this statement.
