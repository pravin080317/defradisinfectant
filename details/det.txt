As discussed, since the SRS roles are not visible in FAT, we will be using existing roles in FAT to mimic the SRS persona testing. Below is our proposed approach:

Roles Selected for Testing in FAT
We have identified the following existing security roles that we will use to mimic the SRS roles in FAT:

FAT Security Role	Access Level	Portal-Related Tables
VOA - System Administrator	Full access across Dataverse	✅ 2 Portal-related tables
VOA - BST Consultant Access	Limited edit access	✅ 1 Portal-related table
Service Reader	Read-only access	✅ All tables (but no write access)
Even though these roles do not cover all portal-related tables, they will help us validate whether users can access and perform essential tasks.

Steps for Testing in FAT
1️⃣ Assign FAT Security Roles to Users

Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center → Select FAT Environment.
Go to Users + Permissions > Security Roles.
Assign the following roles to test users:
VOA - System Administrator → Admin-level access
VOA - BST Consultant Access → Limited portal edit access
Service Reader → Read-only access
2️⃣ User Login & Access Validation

Test users will log in to the FAT Portal and Dataverse backend.
Validate if they can:
Access the portal and backend tables.
Perform basic operations based on their assigned role.
Check if any errors or missing permissions appear.
3️⃣ Perform Portal-Specific Actions

Attempt to view/edit portal records based on assigned roles.
Check if restricted roles (e.g., Service Reader) can only view and not modify records.
Test user access to different portal features (e.g., form submissions, data retrieval).
4️⃣ Document Findings & Next Steps

If successful, we will proceed with SIT testing using SRS-based delegation.
