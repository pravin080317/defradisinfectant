Power Pages Table Permissions Management
1️⃣ Purpose of Table Permissions in Power Pages
Power Pages Table Permissions control which records users can read, write, delete, or update in a Power Pages website. They define the granularity of access to Dataverse tables for portal users and ensure that data is securely exposed only to authorized users.

2️⃣ Why Table Permissions Are Needed?
✅ Security: Prevent unauthorized users from viewing or modifying sensitive records.
✅ Access Control: Enforce role-based access within Power Pages.
✅ Granular Permissions: Unlike Dataverse security roles, table permissions allow specific record-level control.
✅ Compliance: Ensure GDPR and data privacy regulations are met.
3️⃣ Difference Between Power Pages Table Permissions & Security Roles in Dynamics
Feature	Power Pages Table Permissions	Dynamics 365 Security Roles
Scope	Controls access to portal users only	Applies to internal Dynamics users
Access Level	Record-level access (individual tables, parent-child relationships)	Broad security roles (business unit, team, organization)
Where It Applies?	External users accessing Power Pages via portal authentication	Internal CRM users (Dynamics 365 UI)
Configuration Location	Managed in Power Pages Table Permissions settings	Configured in Power Platform Admin Center
Permissions Available	Read, Write, Create, Delete, Append, Append To	Full user permissions (including business unit, team, entity-level security)
Use Case	Restrict what portal users can see or edit	Restrict what Dynamics users can see or edit
Examples	✅ Limit customers to view only their own requests. ✅ Restrict file uploads based on roles.	✅ Allow CRM Admins to modify customer records. ✅ Restrict specific users from modifying sensitive data.
4️⃣ How to Modify Table Permissions in Power Pages?
If there are issues with table permissions, follow these steps:

✅ Step 1: Identify the Issue
Users unable to see data? → Check if Read permission is granted.
Users seeing all records instead of only their own? → Ensure Parent or Global filtering is applied.
Unable to modify/delete records? → Verify if Write/Delete permissions are enabled.
✅ Step 2: Modify the Table Permissions
Go to Power Pages Admin Center.
Navigate to Table Permissions under the selected website.
Select the relevant table (e.g., voap_portalrequests, annotations, file management, etc.).
Adjust the following permissions:
Read: Allow users to view records.
Write: Allow users to edit records.
Create: Allow users to add new records.
Delete: Allow users to remove records.
Append: Allow users to relate records to other tables.
Append To: Allow records to be linked to other entities.
Click Save & Publish to apply changes.
✅ Step 3: Verify Permissions
Login as a portal user and test data access.
Use "Preview Mode" to validate access for different user roles.
Clear cache if changes do not reflect immediately.
5️⃣ Common Issues & Fixes
Issue	Possible Cause	Fix
❌ Users can see all records instead of their own	No parent-child filtering is applied	Apply Parent Table Permission
❌ Users cannot see any records	Read permission is missing	Enable Read access
❌ Users cannot create or edit records	Write/Create/Delete permissions missing	Grant necessary permissions
❌ Users cannot see files or upload documents	File management table permissions missing	Enable access for voap_portalfilemanagement
❌ API endpoint exposes too many records	No filtering applied to API queries	Use OData $select and $filter
6️⃣ Recommended Best Practices
✔ Grant Minimum Required Access

Always follow "Least Privilege" principle (only give users the permissions they need).
✔ Use Parent-Child Relationships

For cases where users should only see their own records, apply "Parent Table Permission" instead of "Global".
✔ Enable Role-Based Access

Assign Web Roles in Power Pages and link them to table permissions.
✔ Test Permissions Before Deployment

Always validate access before making changes live.
✔ Monitor & Review Regularly

Review permissions after Microsoft updates, as new site settings might expose additional data.
