Great clarification. Here's the **updated Jira ticket content** incorporating your new points â€” specifying that:

* The Application Insights endpoint is public.
* The issue is observed only for **some councils** (e.g., Bracknell Forest).
* The **network team** should investigate **client-side or endpoint-level blocks**, not App Insights configuration in Azure.

### ðŸ§¾ **Jira Ticket: Application Insights Tracking Blocked for Specific Councils (e.g., Bracknell Forest)**

**Summary:**
Application Insights events (e.g., `CouncilSwitched`, `LAPortalLogin`) are being blocked in the browser **only for specific councils**, such as **Bracknell Forest**, impacting telemetry visibility.

---

**Description:**
While reviewing telemetry logs, we noticed that **telemetry requests to Application Insights are blocked in the browser** for a few councils. The issue is **not global**, and is **not related to Azure-side configuration**, as Application Insights endpoints are publicly accessible, and the instrumentation key is embedded in the code for logging.

The screenshot attached shows telemetry POST requests being blocked with `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` in the console, observed specifically when accessing via **Bracknell Forest Council** accounts.

---

**Key Points:**

* App Insights uses a **public ingestion endpoint**:
  `https://uksouth-1.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/v2/track`
* Anyone can post to this with a valid instrumentation key.
* Azure-side access restrictions (e.g., firewall) **are not in place**.
* This appears to be a **client-side issue**, possibly due to:

  * Council-specific browser/network settings
  * Endpoint protection software or security extensions
  * DNS/proxy/firewall rules specific to the council network

---

**Evidence:**

* Screenshot showing `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors for Bracknell Forest users
* ApplicationInsights calls (e.g., `trackEvent`) are made correctly in code but never reach Azure

---

**Action Required:**

* [ ] Request **Bracknell Forest Council IT / Network team** to:

  * Investigate whether their browser, proxy, or endpoint security is blocking telemetry requests
  * Check if outbound requests to `*.applicationinsights.azure.com` or Microsoft telemetry domains are restricted
* [ ] Confirm if similar issues exist for other councils or are isolated

---

**Whitelisting Recommendation:**
Ensure the following domains are **not blocked** in the client environment:

* `*.applicationinsights.azure.com`
* `dc.services.visualstudio.com`
* `eu-mobile.events.data.microsoft.com`

---

**Priority:**
Medium â€“ Impacts data analysis and user monitoring for selected councils.
