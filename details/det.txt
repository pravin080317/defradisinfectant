We’re currently reviewing the error handling behavior on the single report submission journey, specifically focusing on the screen reader experience and potential WCAG 2.2 violation related to:

Issue: Error message content is present in the DOM before validation is triggered, and is potentially being read out by screen readers.

We understand that:

Elements with display: none may still be picked up by assistive technologies depending on how they're implemented.

If aria-describedby points to those elements, it may cause confusion for screen reader users.

✅ Request
Could you please help us validate this behavior by:

Running the pages (e.g., report reason selection page and upload page) through Speech Viewer or a screen reader,

And confirm:

Does the screen reader announce the error summary block (govuk-error-summary) when no validation has occurred yet?

Does it read out the <p> tag linked via aria-describedby even when hidden with display: none?

When validation fails, are the correct error messages read once and clearly, without redundancy?
