Here's a clear and professional rewrite of the section for **SVT – Business Process** within the context of Dynamics 365 and Welsh Revaluation:

---

### **SVT – Business Process Overview**

In the context of the **Dynamics 365 platform**, an *application* refers specifically to a **Model-Driven App**, which serves as a navigable interface comprising **Dataverse tables, dashboards, Canvas App custom pages**, and other user interaction elements.

Within the **Welsh Revaluation (Reval)** area of the **CT Case Management App**, users can directly access **Sales Verification Tool (SVT)** functionality, alongside relevant downstream tools such as the **Valuation Tool (VT)** (covered separately in the VT SDD).

#### **Application Areas and Navigation**

| **Area**                          | **Purpose**                                                                | **Notes**                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Sales Verification Tool (SVT)** | Enables search, filtering, review, and verification of Welsh sales records | Integrated into CT Case Management App   |
| **Valuation Tool (VT)**           | Enables banding and valuation processes based on verified sales data       | Covered separately in Valuation Tool SDD |

### **SVT Business Process Flow**

The SVT is designed to enable a **structured, traceable, and persona-driven workflow** that supports the accurate review and verification of sales data by Caseworkers, Managers, and Quality Controllers.

* Users begin by searching and filtering **Sales Reval Records**, sourced from **Azure SQL (VaaS)** via the embedded **Canvas App custom page**.
* Each sales record contains internal data (e.g. sale price, ratio, outlier flags, condition scores) as well as linked external sources (e.g. Land Registry, GSV, Zoopla).
* Caseworkers manually **verify** each sale using this information, entering decisions and justifications.
* Verified records are then submitted for **Quality Assurance (QA)**.
* **QA reviewers** assess submissions and either mark them as "Complete" (if passed), or return them to the **Allocated** state (if failed) with comments for rework.
* Managers oversee assignments via dashboards and can reallocate records if necessary.

This process ensures:

* Seamless integration between **upstream data sources** (e.g., DAP2, LR, SharePoint) and **downstream tools** (e.g., AVM, VT).
* High **data accuracy** at the start of the valuation workflow.
* Consistent, **traceable decisions** that are auditable and reusable.

Let me know if you want this broken down by persona (Caseworker, QA, Manager) or tied back into navigation design (dashboard view, screen flows, etc.).
