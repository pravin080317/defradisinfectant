Implementation Plan:
Pre-Implementation Steps

Confirm business approval and stakeholder agreement for enabling maintenance mode.
Raise a ticket with Rajendran, Praveen, and Aditya (CDIO Cognizant CDPO VOA).
Schedule a screen-sharing session with Aditya or another authorized admin who has Production environment access.
Production Update Steps (to be executed on the day of maintenance)

Log in to Power Pages Admin Center for the Production environment.
Navigate to Site Settings for the Production portal.
Update Site Settings

Locate the site setting: MaintenanceSiteMode
Change the value from False to True.
Locate the site setting: MaintenanceSiteContent
Update the value to include the relevant service resumption date and time (e.g., 9am on Monday 24 March 2025).
Purge Cache

After updating both settings, purge the site cache from the Power Pages Admin Center to ensure the changes are applied immediately.
Verify Redirection

Access key pages of the portal (e.g., /dashboard, /ct-submitted-reports) to confirm that users are redirected to the Maintenance Page.
Test Plan:
Environment:

Perform dry-run testing on a Dev or UAT environment prior to production implementation.
Steps:

Set MaintenanceSiteMode to True and provide a valid value for MaintenanceSiteContent.
Purge cache in the Admin Center.
Validate that:
All non-admin users are redirected to the Maintenance Page.
The correct maintenance date/time content is displayed dynamically from MaintenanceSiteContent.
The back link is hidden on the Maintenance Page as per the custom logic.
Admin users with specific roles (e.g., "CT Users") still retain access if required (test based on your role handling logic).
Set MaintenanceSiteMode back to False and purge cache again.
Confirm that normal portal access is restored.
Worst Case Scenario:
The maintenance redirection logic fails to trigger (due to cache issues or site marker misconfiguration), leading to users still accessing normal portal pages.
Business-critical users are locked out due to misconfigured role-based exceptions (if any are implemented).
Cache purge does not take effect immediately or is missed, leading to inconsistent user experience.
Backout Plan:
Immediate Actions:

Revert the MaintenanceSiteMode setting back to False.
Retain the original value of MaintenanceSiteContent or update as necessary.
Purge the cache again via Power Pages Admin Center to propagate changes.
Validation:

Re-verify that users can now access all portal pages without being redirected to the Maintenance Page.
Communication:

Notify relevant stakeholders that the rollback has been completed.
Additional Notes:
The change is instantaneous post-cache purge.
Recommended to perform this action 15 minutes before maintenance window (e.g., 8:45 AM if the window starts at 9:00 AM).
Ensure Aditya or another authorized admin is available during the window to perform the changes in production.
