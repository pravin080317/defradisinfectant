LA Portal SRS and Security Role Mapping

SRS Roles Categorization

The LA Portal has five distinct SRS roles categorized based on whether they require Dynamics (Dataverse) licenses:

Category 1: Dynamics License Required (Internal Users - Dataverse Access)

These roles are intended for a limited number of internal users, primarily to manage future enhancements, user onboarding, and backend Dataverse operations:

Role Name

Purpose

VOA Portal Admin

Full administrative access to the portal and backend.

VOA Portal Page Admin

Administrative access focused on managing Power Pages.

VOA Portal Viewer

Read-only access to portal functionalities and Dataverse.

Category 2: No Dynamics License Required (Portal Access Only)

These roles cover most external users who interact directly with the portal:

Role Name

Purpose

VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod

Read-only portal access without Dataverse interaction.

VOA Portal Only Admin Prod

Admin-level portal access without Dataverse interaction.

Security Role Mapping for Dynamics License Roles

Currently, only the three Category 1 SRS roles require associated Dynamics security roles. The team has been tasked to:

Create three new Dynamics security roles in the development environment.

Conduct testing and validation in the sandbox environment.

Map these newly created security roles to the corresponding SRS roles.

Include these new roles in the solution and delta solution so they are picked up by the Case Management pipeline in the next build cycle.

These roles will support internal operational needs such as managing user onboarding, handling backend data access, and enabling specific administrative functionalities.
