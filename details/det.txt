### **Usability in Dynamics 365 – Implemented Platform (SVT Context)**

The Sales Verification Tool (SVT) user interface has been developed within the existing **Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App**, using **Canvas App Custom Pages** to deliver flexible, role-based screens aligned to VOA personas (Caseworker, Manager, QC). The design follows GOV.UK and HMRC usability guidelines while leveraging Microsoft Power Platform's rapid prototyping capabilities.

* ✅ The solution uses **Canvas App-based Custom Pages**, embedded into the Council Tax model-driven app. These pages are built using **standard Power Apps controls**, which are **WCAG-compliant by design**, providing accessibility support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.

* ✅ Rather than starting with Miro wireframes, the prototype was rapidly built using **Power Apps Out-of-the-Box (OOB) components**, enabling early user feedback and accelerated business engagement.

* ✅ Screens are structured around **persona roles** (Caseworker, Manager, QC), with access-controlled dashboards and workflows tailored to each role's responsibilities.

* ✅ The **Low-Level Design (LLD)** phase will finalise the UI layout, focusing on interaction flows, tab ordering, field validations, and context-aware help or hints where necessary.

* ✅ The **View Sales Record** screen has multiple data sections (Hereditament, Banding, Sale Summary, LR/MILO/WLTT data, Property Attributes, Hyperlinks, QA, etc.), which requires **vertical scrolling** due to content volume. This trade-off ensures clarity without overloading the user on a single view.

* ✅ Pages make use of **Power Platform components** like:

  * Power Apps form and gallery controls
  * **PCF components** for tabular layout and formatting (e.g., DetailsList)
  * SharePoint image galleries for room condition display
  * Custom command buttons with role-aware logic (e.g., ‘Promote to Master’, ‘Submit’, ‘Calculate’)

* ✅ The application complies with **HTML5 standards** and provides **device-agnostic UI support**, including:

  * Compatibility with all HMRC-supported browsers: **Chrome, Edge, Mobile Safari**
  * Usability across **desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile**
  * No dependency on browser plugins or client-side installations

* ✅ The primary user interaction mode is **desktop browser**, but mobile usability is also supported in read-only or basic input scenarios.

* ✅ All screens and navigation are designed for **clarity and consistency**, minimizing cognitive load and improving user efficiency.

* ✅ **Accessibility and usability testing** will be validated during the test phases, with any improvements fed back into iteration cycles. SRF usability engagement is required as internal-facing UI has been amended.

## **Navigation Within the Application – SVT**

The SVT solution follows consistent and accessible navigation principles aligned to GOV.UK and HMRC standards, delivered using **Dynamics 365 with embedded Canvas App Custom Pages**. The navigation experience is streamlined for ease of use by VOA internal staff personas (Caseworker, Manager, QC), with contextual access and clearly segregated workflows.

---

### **Navigation Within the Application**

* The **left navigation pane** of the Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App provides entry points into “**SVT (Sales Verification Tool)**” and “**Valuation Tool**”.
* Navigation labels avoid acronyms (e.g., "Search Reval Sales Record" instead of "SRR").
* Navigation structure is kept **simple and role-segregated**, with grouping by function (e.g., Caseworker tools vs QC tools).
* **Icons are supported with clear labels** to aid screen reader accessibility.
* Power Platform’s responsive layout ensures navigation works seamlessly on different screen sizes, though core use is expected via desktop.

### **Pages (Canvas Custom Pages in Dynamics)**

Custom Pages have been created and embedded within the Dynamics app, with persona-based access:

| **Page Title**               | **Accessible by** | **Purpose**                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Search Reval Sales Record`  | All personas      | Advanced search screen to query and filter sales from PostgreSQL via virtual table |
| `My Allocated Work`          | Caseworker        | Grid of assigned tasks; launches into verification journey                         |
| `Manager Dashboard`          | Manager           | KPIs, summaries, and quick stats on overall progress                               |
| `Manager Assignment`         | Manager           | Interface to bulk-assign or reassign verification tasks                            |
| `Quality Control Dashboard`  | QC Reviewer       | Overview of submitted verifications; status-wise and reviewer progress             |
| `Quality Control Assignment` | QC Reviewer       | Screen to self-assign QC tasks or review others' submitted work                    |

Each page loads within the Dynamics context, offering single-click return navigation and breadcrumb paths for easy tracking.

---

### **Sales Verification Form – Subpages/Sections**

The **Sales Record Form** (Canvas or Form component) consists of multiple collapsible/scrollable sections:

| **Section**                | **Purpose**                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Hereditament Info`        | Basic property identifiers: Address, Coordinates, Billing Authority   |
| `Banding`                  | Band reference, Band ID, and current/proposed band                    |
| `Sale Summary`             | Sale price, transaction date, outlier flag, ratio, model comparison   |
| `Sales Verification`       | "Useful" toggle, reasons for non-usefulness, and notes                |
| `Condition Score (Canvas)` | Detailed room condition entries (Kitchen, Bathroom, Decoration, etc.) |
| `Sale Calculations`        | Previous/Current ratio, flags, HPI factors                            |
| `LR PPD / MILO`            | LR PPD details or MILO fields (conditionally hidden)                  |
| `WLTT`                     | WLTT details (Transaction price, lease, tenure, agents, etc.)         |
| `Hyperlinks`               | Clickable buttons to EPC, GSV, Zoopla, RightMove, VMS                 |
| `Property Attributes`      | Attribute string for audit/debug reference                            |
| `QA Section`               | Comments box, decision dropdown, and submit button for QC stage       |

Pages are expected to scroll due to the number of logical sections. Navigation between records (next/prev) is offered for efficiency during verification.

---

### **Dashboards and Views**

SVT includes **role-specific dashboards** using Power Apps components and standard Dynamics dashboard controls:

| **Dashboard**          | **Audience** | **Features**                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Manager Dashboard`    | Manager      | Charts, filters, stats on total assigned/completed/QA failed tasks |
| `Caseworker Dashboard` | Caseworker   | My work status (New, In Progress), filter by sale type or area     |
| `QC Dashboard`         | QC Reviewer  | Items awaiting review, pass/fail ratio, workload tracking          |

**Views** (via PCF grid or gallery control) provide:

* Filtering by Outlier, Postcode, UPRN, and Sale Status
* Inline “View Record” buttons for deep dive
* Visual indicators (flags, badges) for quick scanning

Certainly. Below is a **ready-to-use documentation section** tailored specifically for the **SVT (Sales Verification Tool)** solution, focusing on **User Interface Design and Layout Approach** and **Overarching Principles / Guidelines**, considering Power Platform, Canvas Custom Pages, and Dynamics 365 standards.

---

## **User Interface Design and Layout Approach – SVT**

The user interface for SVT has been developed using **Power Platform’s low-code capabilities**, primarily leveraging **Canvas Custom Pages**, embedded into a Dynamics 365 Model-Driven App. The approach aims to deliver **persona-specific, intuitive, and consistent user experiences** across all internal roles involved in the sales verification process (Caseworker, Manager, Quality Control).

### Key Considerations in UI Design

* **Canvas Custom Pages** are built using **Power Apps Controls** (e.g., galleries, data cards, forms, custom components), ensuring they are **WCAG-compliant** and **responsive by default**.
* Where possible, **out-of-the-box Power Platform components** are used to streamline accessibility, support low-code maintainability, and accelerate iteration.
* UI wireframing was **skipped at the prototype stage** to rapidly deliver working screens for review, with final screen layouts to be validated and locked during **Low-Level Design (LLD)** walkthroughs.
* Each custom page aligns with a **single persona** and clearly presents only the fields and controls relevant to that persona's workflow, reducing cognitive load.

### Layout Patterns

* Each screen maintains a **left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order**, aligned to GOV.UK layout guidance and HMRC internal accessibility policies.
* **Sales verification record forms** are split into **multiple logical sections** (e.g., Banding, Sale Summary, Condition Score, LR/WLTT/MILO, QA), allowing progressive disclosure of data while maintaining structure.
* Pages with a high number of data sections (e.g., View Sales Record) include **scrolling**, but maintain consistent padding, headings, and landmark ARIA roles for screen readers.
* **Submit, Assign, and Promote actions** are consistently placed at the **bottom-right** of the form or section, aligned to user action flow.

## **Overarching Principles / Guidelines – SVT UI**

The following overarching principles were adopted in the design and build of SVT:

| Principle                     | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity over Complexity**   | Each screen is designed to show only what the user needs. Complex interactions (like "Promote to Master") are visually isolated and contextual.                  |
| **Persona-driven Screens**    | All screens and controls are built for a specific role (Caseworker, Manager, or QC), reducing cross-persona confusion and avoiding permission-related UX issues. |
| **No Acronyms in UI**         | User-facing text avoids internal abbreviations (e.g., “Useful Sale” instead of “USF”), aligning with GOV.UK content style guidelines.                            |
| **Consistent Navigation**     | Menu entries, dashboards, and views follow a consistent naming convention and layout order. Canvas pages and embedded views reuse common header/footer patterns. |
| **Reusable Components**       | Where needed, PCF components or shared Canvas components are used (e.g., condition scoring, badge displays) to maintain design consistency.                      |
| **Color and Accessibility**   | All buttons, charts, and alerts adhere to VOA color branding and WCAG 2.2 contrast standards. Focus states and keyboard navigation are tested during UAT.        |
| **Minimal Training Required** | UI is designed such that users can perform verification, assignment, and QA actions without requiring extensive documentation or training.                       |
| **Mobile Support (Optional)** | While optimized for desktop, all Canvas Custom Pages are **responsive** and can technically run on tablets or mobile devices for secondary scenarios.            |
