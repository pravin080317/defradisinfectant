📨 Team Update: Template Comparison and Accessibility Testing

Hi team,

We’ve now completed the accessibility-compliant versions of all HTML report templates (Schedule of Alterations, No Action Schedule, Full Valuation List, Statement of Numbers and Bands, and Summary of Numbers and Bands).

Please do the following checks before deployment:


---

🔍 1. Compare Old vs Updated Templates

Open both the old and new templates side-by-side in Visual Studio (or VS Code).

Review the HTML structure and CSS changes – focus on cleaned markup, proper tag hierarchy, and semantic elements (<header>, <main>, <footer>).

Verify that ETL placeholders (e.g. #BA_NAME#, #TABLE_PLACEHOLDER#, #LIST_YEAR#) are unchanged.


🌐 2. Browser Rendering Check

Open each template in a browser (Edge or Chrome).

Confirm that visual formatting (logo, title, tables, footer) matches the previous layout.

Ensure bilingual text (Welsh/English) displays correctly and no overlapping occurs.

Note: the “Translate page from Welsh” prompt may not appear anymore — that’s expected since the new templates correctly declare lang="en" with Welsh segments tagged lang="cy" for accessibility.


♿ 3. Accessibility Verification

Perform quick WCAG validation focusing on:

Language attributes: <html lang="en"> present; Welsh text tagged lang="cy".

Headings: Logical order (H1 → H2, no skipped levels).

Tables: <caption>, <thead>, <th scope="col"> defined.

Alt text: Logo includes descriptive alt text (“Valuation Office Agency logo”).

Landmarks: <header>, <main>, <footer> read correctly by screen readers.

Text scaling: Confirm readability at 200% zoom (no clipping).


You can use:

NVDA or JAWS (screen reader testing)

axe DevTools / WAVE / Accessibility Insights for automated WCAG checks.


✅ Expected Outcome

No functional change in data binding (ETL placeholders still work).

Layout and styling visually consistent with old versions.

Accessibility issues from earlier audits (1.3.1, 3.1.1, 4.1.1) resolved.

Let’s capture any layout deviations or accessibility regressions during testing so we can finalise the rollout package.

Thanks,
