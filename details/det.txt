After reviewing the reported behavior, it appears to be expected functionality rather than a bug. Hereâ€™s why:

The Check and Confirm Details page is not a separate navigation step but rather a dynamically updated version of the Billing Authority Reference Number page (after retrieving the address via API).
Since the Back button navigates to the last independent page, it correctly takes the user back to the Billing Authority Reference Number page, not the dynamically updated state.
From a user perspective, this behavior is actually useful, as it allows users to modify the Billing Authority Reference Number if they realize they need to enter a different one (since the address field is non-editable).
