Key Issues Addressed & Agreed Fixes
1. Dynamic aria-describedby Implementation
Issue: Screen readers announced error messages even when validation wasn’t triggered.

Fix: Now, aria-describedby is dynamically injected into inputs only after validation fails.

Confirmed: This prevents premature error announcements and behaves correctly with VoiceOver and NVDA (once tested).

2. File Upload “Change” Behavior
Issue: Clicking “Change” opened the file picker directly, confusing screen reader users.

Fix: “Change” will now:

Redirect to a previous page (e.g., file upload),

Focus on the “Choose file” input so users are in control.

Further Recommendation: Follow GDS pattern by replacing “Change” with “Remove” + confirmation.

3. Pagination Labels
Issue: aria-label="Go to page 1" was used.

Fix: Changed to just "Page 1" (for simplicity and clarity).

Previous/Next Buttons: Replaced aria-label with visually hidden spans (<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Next page</span>).

4. Text Wrapping for Long Filenames
Issue: Filenames overflowed success banners on mobile.

Fix: Use word-wrap: break-word; and GOV.UK class govuk-panel.

Next Step: Apply consistently across success messages.

5. Heading Hierarchy & Font Classes
Issue: Same-level headings (e.g., h2) had inconsistent font sizes.

Fix:

Inner pages use .govuk-heading-m.

Dashboard’s “Need help?” section uses .govuk-heading-l for visual clarity.

Conclusion: Variation is acceptable if semantic structure is correct and visual hierarchy is preserved.

6. Error Message & Validation Fixes
Error messages will only be:

Added to aria-describedby after failed validation,

Displayed only when needed (removing use of display:none where possible),

Set with aria-invalid="true" only for failed fields (cleared when valid).

7. Radio Groups & Fieldset Usage
Confirmed: For radio buttons, aria-describedby goes on the fieldset, not individual inputs.

8. Feedback Form
Fix:

Removed unnecessary fieldsets around single inputs.

Added aria-describedby dynamically based on validation.

Limit textarea to 1200 characters using GOV.UK character count pattern.
