Here’s a **rewritten version** of your SharePoint usage section, **tailored for the SVT (Sales Verification Tool)** scenario where SharePoint is used to store a static image library for reference (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, finishes) — aligned to your provided structure:

---

## **SharePoint Usage – Sales Verification Tool (SVT)**

The SVT solution leverages HMRC’s existing M365 tenant which hosts multiple SharePoint sites. A dedicated **SharePoint document library** is used in SVT to **permanently store static property reference images** (unstructured data), such as photographs of kitchens, bathrooms, glazing, and finishes. These are used solely for **reference** during the sales verification process, to help standardise **condition scoring** and assessment of attributes.

Unlike traditional case-related files, the SVT image library is not tied to a specific UPRN or request. Instead, it acts as a **central reference gallery**, accessible within the **Power Apps Canvas UI** embedded in the SVT custom pages.

### **Use**

| Use Case                 | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reference Images**     | A curated set of sample images to support condition scoring (e.g., kitchen age, spec, finishes, etc.). Each image includes structured metadata. |
| **Image Metadata**       | Metadata fields include: `Image Type`, `Room Type`, `Age`, `Specification Level`, `Condition`, `Image URL`, and `Alt Description`.              |
| **Lookup and Filtering** | Used within SVT Canvas Apps to filter and preview reference images based on selected verification fields.                                       |
| **Non-UPRN-bound**       | These images are **not associated with any UPRN, request, or job** and serve purely as guidance visuals.                                        |

### **SVT SharePoint Usage Table**

| Principle                          | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication & Authorisation** | Access is secured via HMRC's **Microsoft Entra ID (AAD)** with **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Role-based access is controlled via **SRS security roles**. Only internal SVT users within the tenant can access these galleries.                |
| **Access via Power Apps**          | The document library is **not accessed directly**. Instead, it is surfaced within the **SVT Canvas App** using the **SharePoint connector**. The image gallery control presents files to the user with associated metadata for filtering. |
| **UI Access**                      | No direct user interaction with SharePoint UI is expected or required. The document library is designed for **read-only consumption** within the SVT app. Upload and tagging are **admin-controlled**.                                    |
| **Structured Metadata**            | Each image includes metadata for filtering, e.g.: `Room Type (Kitchen, Bathroom)`, `Age (year)`, `Spec (Basic, Modern, High-end)`, `Condition Category (A, B, C)` etc.                                                                    |
| **Logging**                        | Access to SharePoint is logged via **Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Logs**. Image access via Power Apps is routed through Microsoft Graph, ensuring **audit traceability**.                                                                  |
| **Monitoring**                     | SharePoint site health and availability are monitored using **Log Analytics** and **App Insights** under standard M365 service-level tooling.                                                                                             |
| **Error Handling**                 | The Power Apps SharePoint connector uses **native error messages** from the SharePoint API, which can be caught and surfaced for admin use.                                                                                               |
| **Backups**                        | As part of SharePoint Online’s resilience strategy:                                                                                                                                                                                       |

* Files are **geo-redundant**, stored in **2 regions**.
* A **3-stage delete model** ensures safety against accidental loss:

  1. First delete → site recycle bin
  2. Second delete → site collection recycle bin (retained for 90 days)
  3. Third delete → permanent deletion
* Additionally, **14-day retention** is available beyond deletion. |
  \| **Compliance**      | As with all HMRC file storage, SharePoint usage in SVT adheres to GDS and internal data handling standards. Images are **internal only**, used for **visual guidance**, and not linked to any personal or case-specific data. |

Would you like me to create a **table of image metadata fields**, or include a **diagram showing flow from SharePoint to Canvas UI** for this image gallery?
