Here‚Äôs a **structured summary** of the accessibility issues and guidance discussed during the call, focusing on HTML semantics, structure, and ARIA usage:

## ‚úÖ **Summary of Accessibility Issues and Fixes**

### üÜó 1. **Issue #9297 ‚Äì Address Lookup (Redundant Text / Heading Nesting)**

* **Problem:**

  * `H1` contained a **nested `label`**, causing redundant content and an invalid structure.
  * Postcode field had a label **and** heading combined improperly.

* **Fix Required:**

  * Follow **GOV.UK Design System** pattern:

    * Use **`<h1>`** for the **page heading only**.
    * Follow it with a **`<label>`** for the input, **not nested** inside the `h1`.
  * Use hint text and input separately, as per standard GOV.UK form layout.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. **Misuse of `h2` Headings Across Pages**

* **Problem:**

  * Pages were using `h2` headings **unnecessarily**, even when only a single form/question exists.
  * Introduces unnecessary "subsections", confusing for screen reader users.

* **Guidance:**

  * **Only use `h2`** when the content truly **has a subsection** under the main `h1`.
  * For **simple forms or single questions**, use **labels only**, **not headings**.
  * **Feedback page** is a key example where `h2` should be **removed** and replaced with just `label`.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. **Use of `role="alert"` on Individual Field Errors**

* **Problem:**

  * `role="alert"` was used on individual error messages (e.g., inline field validation).
  * Creates **redundant announcements** and **overlaps** with the main error summary.

* **Fix Required:**

  * **Remove `role="alert"`** from inline error messages.
  * Let the **error summary box (at top)** with `role="alert"` handle the announcement.

### üü° 4. **General Recommendations & Action Points**

| Area                     | Action                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h1` and `label` nesting | Ensure **labels are not inside headings**                                                             |
| Heading hierarchy        | **Remove `h2`** from simple forms unless a logical section is present                                 |
| `role="alert"` misuse    | Use **only on the error summary**, not on inline field errors                                         |
| Design System compliance | **Strictly follow GOV.UK Design System** structure to avoid extra `aria-describedby` or ID attributes |
| Rollout caution          | Fix only where necessary ‚Äî avoid over-applying global structural changes (like h2s) blindly           |
| UAT rollout              | Apply scoped fixes ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí review with accessibility team                                          |

### üìÖ **Next Steps**

* Team to:

  * Audit where unnecessary `h2`s have been applied.
  * Remove `role="alert"` from inline errors.
  * Restructure form pages per design system.
* A follow-up call is scheduled (Friday suggested) to:

  * Review updated pages.
  * Validate consistent application of GOV.UK patterns.
  * Identify any missed issues.
