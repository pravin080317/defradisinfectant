Key Discussion Points:
Current Deployment Pipeline:

The main case deployment pipeline is integrated and monolithic.

It is not possible to run only the APIM part independently.

Any changes to APIM policies by KACE need to be reviewed before deployment to avoid releasing unintended changes.

Options for Deployment:

Option 1 (Manual):

Manually add the required changes in the Azure Portal for APIM.

Requires approval from Helen Murphy.

Simple and quick: someone with permissions can complete it in a few clicks.

Option 2 (Pipeline Update):

Add an extra step to the portal deployment pipeline to deploy the APIM product.

This step can be removed later.

Requires Devesh's involvement to update the pipeline.

Option 3 (Wait for Release 1.1):

Delay until Release 1.1 is deployed.

Not ideal as it would delay the schedule download functionality.

Decision:

Proceed with Option 2 (update the portal pipeline) as the preferred approach.

Option 1 (manual) will be explored as a backup plan.

Option 3 is not viable due to the delay it would cause.

Action Items:
Michael to Provide Instructions:

Provide clear instructions on what needs to be added manually in the Azure Portal for APIM.

Include a brief description or screenshot of the steps.

Engage Helen Murphy for Manual Option (Plan A):

Discuss the manual deployment option with Helen Murphy for approval.

Ensure this is a temporary solution until Release 1.1.

Update Portal Pipeline (Plan B):

Request Devesh's time to add an extra step to the portal deployment pipeline.

Coordinate with Andy Gill to agree on the pipeline update.

Timeline: Aim to finalize by Monday.

Hold for Release 1.1 (Plan C):

If Plans A and B are not feasible, hold until Release 1.1 is deployed.

Follow-Up with Mikil:

Discuss the findings and confirm that a full deployment from KACE is required for the APIM part.

Ensure segregation of changes to avoid unintended deployments.

Next Steps:
Michael to provide instructions for manual deployment.

Initiate discussions with Helen Murphy and Devesh for Plans A and B.

Confirm pipeline update timeline with Andy Gill.

Follow up with Mikil for further clarification..
