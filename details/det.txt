Based on our current understanding of the SVT features and requirements, we would appreciate your confirmation on the following points:

Task Assignment Process:
Please confirm that the system will not auto-assign tasks to caseworkers. Our understanding is that:

The system will generate tasks and update the Task ID in VaaS (DAP2).

Team Managers will manually allocate these tasks to caseworkers.

In the event of a QA "Fail", the QA reviewer will manually reassign the task back to the original caseworker.

User Roles and Setup:
Are the SVT users (Team Manager, Caseworker, QA Reviewer) existing internal users currently using the existing platform?

If not, and these are new users, weâ€™ll need to consider Dataverse team creation, role-based access configuration, and SRS role provisioning as part of the setup.
