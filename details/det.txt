Action Items from the Discussion
The following action items were identified to resolve the SSL certificate issue and improve security processes:

Immediate Actions (Mitigation & Cleanup)
âœ… [Completed] Delete the ADO Repository

The repository containing the private key has been deleted to prevent further exposure.
Any local copies on individual machines have also been removed.
âœ… [Completed] Confirm Certificate Presence in Key Vault

Verified that the correct SSL certificate is stored securely in Azure Key Vault.
âœ… [Completed] Document the Incident & Initial Fix

Logged the issue in the security incident management system for tracking and audit purposes.
Next Steps (Process Fixes & Preventive Measures)
ðŸš€ 1. Establish a Secure Certificate Transfer Process (High Priority)
Owner: Colin & Cloud Team
Due Date: Next Security Meeting (Tentatively Tuesday)

Define a process for securely transferring certificates between:
Estes (Procurement Team)
Cloud Team (Azure Key Vault Management)
ECS Team (SSL Certificate Installation)
Investigate automated solutions, such as:
Granting ECS temporary access to Key Vault.
Using Key Vaultâ€™s built-in certificate management features to share securely.
ðŸš€ 2. Request & Deploy a New SSL Certificate (High Priority)
Owner: Sharon & Cloud Team
Due Date: Before March 11 Go-Live

Initiate a request for a new SSL certificate.
Delay delivery until a secure transfer mechanism is in place.
Engage ECS early to avoid last-minute deployment delays.
ðŸš€ 3. Review & Restrict Access to Key Vault (Security Measure)
Owner: Cloud Team
Due Date: Post-Go-Live

Restrict access to Key Vault certificates to only necessary users.
Audit Key Vault permissions and ensure only authorized teams can handle SSL certificates.
ðŸš€ 4. Implement a Certificate Management Governance Policy (Process Improvement)
Owner: Cynthia & Colin
Due Date: Before the next certificate renewal cycle

Develop an official governance policy for handling SSL certificates.
Document:
Who owns certificate procurement, storage, and installation?
What secure transfer methods should be followed?
How certificate expiration and renewals should be managed?
ðŸš€ 5. Engage Microsoft Consultants for Best Practices (Optional Support)
Owner: Colin
Due Date: As needed

Check with Microsoftâ€™s Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM) to validate security best practices.
ðŸš€ 6. Raise ECS Ticket for Certificate Deployment (Proactive Step) (Avoid Delay)
Owner: Richard & Sharon
Due Date: Immediately

Raise an ECS ticket in advance to schedule SSL certificate installation once the new cert is available.
Ensure global admin permissions are available to complete the installation.
Follow-Up Meeting:
ðŸ“… Next Catch-up: Tuesday (Tentative)

Review progress on the new certificate procurement.
Validate secure transfer mechanism feasibility.
Confirm ECS readiness for deployment.
Key Takeaways:
Never store secrets in Git repositories.
Use Key Vault with proper access control for certificates.
Automate secure certificate transfer instead of manual processes.
Involve security teams early in the process to prevent similar issues.
