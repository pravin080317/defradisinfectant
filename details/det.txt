Discussion Points & Decisions
1. SRS Roles & Security Testing in Different Environments
Issue Identified:

The new SRS security roles currently do not have permissions assigned.
Attempting to log in using these roles results in an error exception.
Dev environment cannot be used for security testing due to restrictions.
In FAT, the SRS roles are not visible, as FAT uses a role switch-up configuration.
Proposed Solution:

Mimic SRS roles in FAT by directly assigning equivalent security roles to users.
Perform preliminary testing in FAT before SIT.
In FAT, permissions will not be delegated by teams like in SRS, but can still be tested for validity.
Action Items:

âœ… Mimic the SRS roles in FAT by assigning security roles directly.
âœ… Conduct preliminary security testing for SRS roles in FAT before SIT.
ðŸ“Œ (Follow-up) Reach out to Mark & Liam to discuss testing approach and feasibility.
2. Access to Production for Support Teams (Post Go-Live)
Issue Identified:

Currently, no roles are assigned for Dev or Prod support teams.
There is no defined process for granting security access in Prod after Go-Live.
App Insights integration is broken in Prod, preventing logs from being accessed.
Proposed Solution:

Short-Term:
Request read-only access to Prod for support users.
Discuss with Helen Murphy before requesting System Admin access.
Long-Term:
Implement System Configurator or custom roles instead of full admin access.
Fix App Insights to enable monitoring without requiring direct Prod access.
Action Items:

âœ… Discuss Prod access process with Helen Murphy before requesting roles.
âœ… Request read-only access for support users in Prod.
âœ… Investigate App Insights issue & ensure logging works as expected.
ðŸ“Œ Follow-up with Microsoft on App Insights failure resolution.
3. Performance Analyst Access & Reporting
Issue Identified:

Performance Analyst role validation in SIT is completed.
Need to confirm dashboard access for users like Emma.
API data retrieval setup needs validation for Prod implementation.
Proposed Solution:

Performance Analyst Dashboard:
Emma should be able to access the Power BI dashboard directly.
Summary reports will also be provided.
Next Steps for API Data Retrieval:
Validate that data retrieval via API works correctly in SIT.
If validated, replicate the same setup in Prod.
Action Items:

âœ… Confirm Emma's access to the Power BI dashboard in SIT.
âœ… Validate API-based data retrieval for reporting.
ðŸ“Œ Schedule a follow-up with Mark & Liam to confirm the final roles for Prod.
4. Sandbox Environments & Access for Dev Team
Issue Identified:

The Dev team cannot access certain sandbox environments.
Some sandboxes are broken, and need to be checked for feasibility of fixing.
These sandboxes are not associated with SRS roles.
Proposed Solution:

Grant Dev team access to sandbox environments via access groups.
Investigate broken sandboxes to determine if they can be restored.
Request COE or ECS support for access provisioning.
Action Items:

âœ… Request access to sandbox environments for Dev team.
âœ… Investigate broken sandboxes for feasibility of restoration.
ðŸ“Œ Follow up with COE/ECS teams for access requests.
