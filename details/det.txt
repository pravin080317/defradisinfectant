Title:
Bug: SDES Rejecting .docx File Type Despite Initial Acknowledgement

Type:
Bug

Priority:
High

Description:
There appears to be an inconsistency in the SDES file handling process in PROD. A .docx file uploaded as part of a standard evidence submission initially triggered an automated confirmation email from SDES confirming successful receipt and secure storage:

File: 01634f32-a308-f011-bae2-6045bd0f8cf5.docx
Received Timestamp: 24/03/2025 11:29:23

However, a follow-up communication from SDES support indicated that .docx is not an accepted file extension for this type of transfer (Request ID: 19581). This discrepancy raises a potential PROD incident, as .docx is one of the expected and supported formats for evidence uploads.

Impact:

Creates confusion around allowed file types for users uploading evidence.

Possibility of file rejection after confirmation email is misleading and can lead to data loss or rework.

Impacts the automation and user experience for LA Portal submissions.

Steps to Reproduce:

Upload a .docx file to SDES via the evidence submission flow.

Observe initial success message from SDES confirming secure storage.

Receive a follow-up email rejecting the .docx file type.

Expected Result:
.docx should be consistently accepted across all stages of the process, or if restricted, validation should occur before upload confirmation.

Actual Result:
File acknowledged as received, followed by a rejection notification for unsupported extension.

Proposed Next Steps:

Raise with Katie and Abo for clarification on accepted file types.

Investigate SDES integration rules/config for file type handling.

Update validation logic if .docx is indeed unsupported, or ensure SDES configuration allows it.
