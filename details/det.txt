Implement Conditional Enable/Disable Logic for Submission Buttons Across Upload Journeys

ðŸ“„ Description:
As part of improving the user experience and submission flow consistency, we need to implement logic to conditionally enable or disable submission buttons across various upload paths. This includes:

Multiple Upload Reports â€“ restrict submission until required files are uploaded

Single Upload Submission â€“ disable until the necessary fields/files are completed

Evidence Submission â€“ prevent submission unless minimum criteria are met

Scope:
Analyse current UX behavior and backend triggers for each journey

Sync with the Content and Design team to ensure messages or labels guide the user appropriately

Identify common patterns or reuse options for the enable/disable logic

Implement and test the changes in dev environment

Include accessibility considerations (e.g., screen reader messages for disabled buttons)
