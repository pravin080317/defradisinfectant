Steps to Remove Portal Search Indexing from Annotation Table (e.g., for Notes):
1. Create a Temporary Solution
Go to Power Apps > Solutions

Create a new unmanaged solution

Name it based on the JIRA ticket (e.g., BST-1234_RemoveNotesIndex)

Add publisher and version info as needed

2. Add Only the Specific View (Not the Entire Table)
In the solution, click "Add existing" → "Table"

Search for annotation (Notes table)

When prompted:

Uncheck everything (forms, dashboards, etc.)

Only check the view named Portal Search

✅ This ensures you’re not importing the full table—just the specific view component into your temp solution.

3. Rename the View
Still inside the temp solution:

Click the Portal Search view of the annotation table

Open it in the view editor

Rename it (e.g., Portal Search Disabled or Notes View for Portal)

Save and publish the view

4. Publish All Customizations
In the solution, click Publish All Customizations
