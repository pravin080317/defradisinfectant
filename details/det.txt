Create three new security roles and map them to corresponding SRS roles. Additionally, an existing Model-Driven App will be used to allow users to access tables in a centralized location, requiring a new Add-on Security Role to grant users access to the app.

Description:
To ensure proper access control for LA Portal internal users, we need to:

Create three new security roles and map them to existing SRS roles:

VOA Portal Admin → VOA Portal Administrator (Dataverse Security Role)
VOA Portal Page Admin → VOA Portal Page Administrator (Dataverse Security Role)
VOA Portal Viewer → VOA Portal Internal Viewer (Dataverse Security Role)
Leverage an existing Model-Driven App to provide users with a single access point for relevant Dataverse tables.

Create a new Add-On Security Role:

Role Name: ADDON: LA Portal Workspace Application
Purpose: Grants access to the Model-Driven App for LA Portal users.
This ensures users can access the necessary tables within a unified interface instead of scattered permissions across individual tables.
Integrate into the Case Management Pipeline:

The new security roles, add-on role, and Model-Driven App must be included in the case pipeline to ensure proper deployment and access control.
This update is dependent on the case pipeline, ensuring it is delivered in the next available release.

Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Three new security roles are created and mapped to the respective SRS roles.
✅ The existing Model-Driven App is confirmed as the central access point for users to interact with tables.
✅ A new Add-On Role (LA Portal Workspace Application) is created and assigned to relevant users.
✅ Security roles and access are tested in DEV before being included in the case pipeline for deployment to higher environments.
✅ Documentation is updated in the Runbook with mappings and permissions.
