This feature focuses on presenting detailed and structured views of sale data aggregated from multiple sources — Reval Sales, WLTT, LRPPD, MILO, PAD — so that caseworkers can make informed verification decisions and raise enhancement cases if discrepancies are found. Some fields are editable (e.g., selected source), while others are view-only. Data consistency, audit, and UX coherence with existing VOA tooling are key goals.

This feature will be delivered via a Canvas Custom Page (Sales Details View) in the SVT solution, integrating with APIs that pull curated data joins from DAP2.

The page will:

Present Reval Sale and linked source datasets in grouped attribute sections

Visually flag differences or inconsistencies between sources

Allow editable fields like source selection, condition scores

Show hyperlinks to PAD records or back to raw data

Trigger updates to SV Outcome or raise PAD enhancement requests

Keep audit logs via Dataverse plugin/custom API


PAD Attributes

Source Verification	Current source, select alternative, mark “source changed”
Outlier Score/Reason	Numeric value, flag, reason codes
Raise PAD Enhancement	Button triggers case creation in Dynamics




API from DAP2 returns clean, structured, joined data for the given sale.

Only limited fields are editable (primarily source selection, outcome, remarks).

PAD enhancement cases are managed exclusively within Dynamics (SVT only triggers wrapper).


Confirm final field schema from DAP2 for each data source (WLTT, LRPPD, MILO).

DAP2 must expose joined dataset via API (GET /svt/sales/{saleId}).

PAD enhancement case management must be integrated with VOS/DLM pipeline.

Final confirmation from business on editable vs read-only fields.
