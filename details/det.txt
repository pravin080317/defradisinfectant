Story 1: Design Validation Matrix for Bulk Submission Flow
Description:
Create a detailed validation matrix for bulk submission journeys to align portal validations with business expectations. This includes rules for BRF, BA Report, UPRN, and address matching errors.

Story 2: Develop Unified Portal Validation Wrapper
Description:
Enhance the existing validation wrapper to centralize and enforce all LA Portal-specific validation rules (approx. 20-25 rules) for bulk and single report journeys. This will decouple legacy validations from portal logic.

Story 3: Implement Custom Validation Logic for BRF, BA Report, and UPRN
Description:
Develop portal-specific validation logic for:

BRF (mandatory or optional based on journey type)

BA Report (length, alphanumeric check, truncation logic)

UPRN (optional validation and error suppression logic)

This will be configurable via the Portal Exceptions Table.

Story 4: Configure Portal Exceptions Table for Dynamic Validation Control
Description:
Enhance and configure the Portal Exceptions Reference Data Table to allow business users to toggle validation severity (e.g., Required vs Not Required) for different error types.

Story 5: Engage with Business Stakeholders to Finalize Validation Rules
Description:
Collaborate with Emma and other business stakeholders to finalize the validation rules matrix and gather approval before implementation.





conversation focuses on improving and streamlining the validation framework for LA Portal submissions, particularly addressing discrepancies between the legacy system validations and the new LA Portal validations.

Key Takeaways:
1. Current Situation:
The existing validation logic is a mix of legacy validations and portal-specific validations, causing inconsistency.

Legacy systems have their own set of validations that were originally designed based on system limitations or outdated business logic.

Some validations from legacy are now redundant or misaligned with what the business currently expects for the LA Portal.

2. Identified Issues:
Fields like BA Reference (BRF), BA Report, and UPRN have conflicting validation rules between the portal and legacy system.

For example:

BRF is mandatory in the single web file journey but not necessarily enforced in bulk submissions.

UPRN has separate validations, but it’s an optional field on the portal.

Some records go to "Fix Errors" even when business wants them to proceed to "Submitted Reports" if certain fields are blank but not critical (e.g., UPRN).

3. Proposed Improvement:
Build a new validation wrapper exclusively for LA Portal:

Decouple from legacy validations.

Maintain a clean rule set that’s specific to the portal’s business flow.

Provide flexibility to configure validations at the portal level (e.g., via reference tables like the Portal Exceptions Table).

Centralize all portal validations (around 20-25 validation rules) and extend existing portal rules for:

BRF validations (mandatory or not).

BA Report validations (length, alphanumeric checks).

UPRN validations.

Address matching validations (to reduce "manual review" status).

4. Benefits:
Business control: Emma and the business team can decide which validations are critical (e.g., is BRF truly mandatory for bulk uploads?).

Cleaner process: Reduces portal vs. legacy mismatch.

Better data quality: Aligns the validation closer to business expectations while keeping the flexibility.

More automation: Less manual intervention and fewer "Complete with address matching errors".

5. Next Steps:
Define a validation matrix (like what’s done in the single web file journey) for bulk submissions.

Extend the new validation wrapper Michael is working on to incorporate all rules into a unified logic.

Align with Emma and stakeholders to confirm validation rules.
