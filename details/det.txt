Structured Checklist for Security Group Cleanup & Portal Role Adjustments
1️⃣ Identify Security Group Dependencies
🔲 Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center → Environments → Settings → Teams
🔲 Check if the VOA_BST_DEV_SG is still listed as an active Microsoft Entra ID Security Group.
🔲 Verify if the following environments still rely on the security group:

voabstportaltest.crm11.dynamics.com
voabstportaldev.crm11.dynamics.com
voabstnpdev.crm11.dynamics.com
voabstcfsdev.crm11.dynamics.com 🔲 Take note of the security group type (Azure AD Security Group vs. SRS Role).
2️⃣ Identify Affected Users & Roles
🔲 Go to Power Platform Admin Center → Environments → Settings → Teams.
🔲 Check how many users are assigned to VOA_BST_DEV_SG.
🔲 List users currently mapped to this group and their assigned Dataverse Security Roles.
🔲 Determine if removing the group will revoke their access.

3️⃣ Validate Alternative Access Management
🔲 Check if a new security group is replacing VOA_BST_DEV_SG.
🔲 Confirm if users will be manually assigned instead.
🔲 Verify if Azure AD Teams (SRS Roles) are taking over access control.
🔲 If SRS Roles are used:

Check how they are mapped to Dataverse Security Roles.
Verify if internal users have proper role-based access.
Ensure Dataverse permissions match previous access levels.
4️⃣ Verify Portal Access for External Users
🔲 Go to Power Pages Admin Center → Portal Management App → Web Roles.
🔲 Ensure that Portal Users (external) still have the correct Table Permissions.
🔲 If security groups were handling access before:

Verify that Web Roles are still mapped correctly.
Ensure no unintended loss of access for external users.
Adjust Table Permissions if necessary.
5️⃣ Review and Confirm Required Changes
🔲 If VOA_BST_DEV_SG is still active but scheduled for removal:

Plan for migrating affected users to a new access model.
Ensure internal & external user access remains uninterrupted. 🔲 If the group has already been removed, confirm:
Users can still log in to Power Pages & Dataverse.
No errors in accessing tables, records, or permissions. 🔲 Document findings and update the JIRA ticket with:
Which environments were checked.
How access will be managed after removal.
Any required fixes or role adjustments.

✅ Affected environments identified and checked.
✅ Alternative access control validated (SRS Roles, manual assignments).
✅ Power Pages portal roles & table permissions are updated if required.
✅ JIRA ticket is updated with findings & recommendations.
