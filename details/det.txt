Title: Design and Impact Analysis for Centralized Address Table Adoption in Portal

Description:
The case management team is proposing to use a centralized Address Table across all related Dataverse entities to reduce address duplication and streamline integration logic. This story is to analyze the potential impacts of this change on the portal, including the current front-door and bulk submission workflows, and to design an approach for implementing this change in the portal.

Acceptance Criteria:
Assess how the centralized Address Table will affect current address capture in:

Portal File Management table

Portal Request Submission table

Request Line Item table

Evaluate changes needed in front-door plugins (e.g., address match, SSU ID assignment).

Propose a solution for referencing the centralized Address Table instead of persisting address fields in multiple tables.

Identify changes to UI/UX where applicable (e.g., where addresses are displayed or modified).

Document a high-level design including updated data flow and entity relationship diagram (ERD).

Provide a list of portal-side API/plugin updates required.

Highlight risks (e.g., data migration of historical addresses, integration timing with case management backend).

Tasks under this ticket:
Task 1: Current State Assessment
Analyze how address fields are currently captured and stored in portal tables (including plugins and front-end components).

Task 2: Centralized Address Table Schema Review
Review schema structure of the new centralized Address Table from case management.

Task 3: Impact on Address Matching and SSU ID Logic
Analyze how address match logic, including SSU ID population, will be affected when switching to a centralized address record.

Task 4: Front-Door/Plugin Changes
Identify required plugin/service layer changes to reference and populate centralized address records instead of storing full addresses directly in portal-specific tables.

Task 5: Design Document Preparation
Prepare a solution design document, including:

ERD changes (new relationships)

Data flow diagrams (before/after)

Technical steps for integration

Risks and mitigation plan
