Deleting the Existing Power Pages Site
Why is this step necessary?
As part of the environment reset, the existing Power Pages site must be deleted before a new installation. This ensures that any outdated configurations, old references, and dependencies from the previous portal instance do not interfere with the fresh setup. Since Power Pages is tightly integrated with Dataverse, deleting the old site also helps avoid conflicts with Dataverse tables, authentication settings, and Azure Entra ID app registrations.
