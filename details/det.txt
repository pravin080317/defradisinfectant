Here are the end-to-end steps to get your Application Insights–backed Power BI report set up with a scheduled refresh in the Power BI Service—no manual portal clicks needed once it’s in your pipeline:

1. **Publish your report to Power BI Service**
   In Power BI Desktop, click **Publish** on the Home ribbon and choose the workspace you want. This uploads your .pbix (including the Power Query that pulls from App Insights) into the Service as a dataset plus report. ([help.precoro.com][1])

2. **Verify or update your data-source credentials**

   * In the Power BI Service, go to the workspace and click the **⚙️ Settings** gear, then choose the **Datasets + dataflows** tab.
   * Under **Data source credentials**, find your Application Insights entry and click **Edit credentials**. Sign in via Azure AD (OAuth) or paste in your App Insights API key as you did in Desktop.
   * Because App Insights is a cloud service, you do **not** need an on-premises gateway—your credentials carry over from Desktop. ([learn.microsoft.com][2], [learn.microsoft.com][3])

3. **Turn on and configure Scheduled Refresh**

   * Still in your dataset’s settings, scroll to the **Scheduled refresh** section and flip **Keep your data up to date** to **On**.
   * Choose your frequency (e.g. daily or weekly) and the time slots you want. Pro workspaces let you pick up to **8** refreshes per day; Premium up to **48** per day. ([velosio.com][4], [learn.microsoft.com][3])

4. **Save settings and (optionally) trigger a manual refresh**

   * Click **Apply** or **Save** at the bottom.
   * You can always hit **Refresh now** to pull data on-demand—this does **not** count against your scheduled-refresh quota. ([learn.microsoft.com][3])

5. **Monitor Refresh History**

   * Right-click your dataset in the workspace list (or click the **…** menu) and choose **Schedule Refresh**.
   * In that panel, click **Refresh history** to see successes, failures, and any error details. ([stackoverflow.com][5])

Once this is in place, your App Insights data will flow into Power BI on the cadence you defined—no more manual trips into the portal required.

When you import Application Insights data via Power Query into Power BI, it doesn’t auto-refresh in the service—you must configure a **scheduled refresh** on the dataset.  The limits are:

* **Power BI Pro (shared capacity):** up to **8 scheduled refreshes** per 24-hour period ([learn.microsoft.com][1]).
* **Power BI Premium (dedicated capacity):** up to **48 scheduled refreshes** per day (i.e. roughly every 30 minutes) ([learn.microsoft.com][1]).

Some other things to know:

* You choose fixed time slots (in the UI you can only pick the top or bottom of the hour—that is, :00 or :30) ([sqlservercentral.com][2]).
* The service will attempt to kick off your refresh within 15 minutes before or after each scheduled slot ([learn.microsoft.com][3]).
* **On-demand (“Refresh now”)** does not count against your scheduled-refresh quota.

If you need more real-time data, you can switch to **DirectQuery** with **Automatic page refresh** (Premium only), or build a Power Automate flow / use the REST API to trigger refreshes beyond the UI limits.
