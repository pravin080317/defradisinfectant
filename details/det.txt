Before applying the suggested fix, I first carried out validation to confirm whether Power Pages was indeed causing the indexing issue.

I unchecked the annotation (notes) table from the Manage Search Index in the Default Solution.

Then, I navigated through various portal UI pages that interact with the notes table (e.g., file upload).

After testing, I verified that the annotation table was not automatically re-enabled for indexing.

This raises a question about whether Power Pages is truly triggering the re-indexing in our case—or if something else might be involved.

To proceed safely, I’ve now created a temporary solution in Dev and added only the Portal Search view of the annotation table (not the entire table).
This was done just now, after completing the above investigation, to help validate Microsoft's guidance while minimizing risk.

Let me know if you’d like me to continue with the view renaming and publish the changes.
