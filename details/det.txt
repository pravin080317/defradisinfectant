Power Pages Security Model: Table Permissions, Dataverse Security Roles, and SRS Roles

This section outlines the access control mechanisms used in the LA Portal, differentiating between Table Permissions for external users, Dataverse Security Roles for internal users, and SRS Roles (Azure AD Teams) for managing internal role-based access.

Key Components

1️⃣ Table Permissions (For External Users)

What They Control:

✅ Define access control inside Power Pages for external users.✅ Restrict what data (tables) external users can read, write, update, or delete.✅ Ensure that only the right external users can access specific records.✅ Not linked to Dataverse security roles or Azure AD teams—specific to Power Pages only.

How They Work:

📌 They control access only within the portal by defining what records external users can interact with.📌 Can be configured with:

Global: All records in the table.

Parent-Filtered: Only records related to a parent entity.

Contact-Based: Only records linked to the logged-in user.

Account-Based: Only records linked to the user’s account.

Your Configuration Example:

VOA Portal Request → Parent-Filtered access.

VOA Portal File Management → Parent-Filtered access.

VOA Portal Only Viewer Prod → No Dataverse access, only portal access.

2️⃣ Dataverse Security Roles (For Internal Users)

What They Control:

✅ Define Dataverse-level permissions for internal users.✅ Control what internal users can see & do inside Dataverse, Power Pages backend, and Dynamics 365.✅ These are mapped to Azure AD Teams (SRS Roles).

How They Work:

📌 Internal users in Dataverse/Dynamics 365 need proper Dataverse Security Roles to access tables directly.📌 Power Pages does NOT use Dataverse Security Roles directly—only internal users in Dynamics use them.📌 Security roles in Dataverse can be assigned manually or mapped via Azure AD teams.

Your Configuration Example:

VOA Portal Administrator → Full control over portal-related Dataverse records.

VOA Portal Page Administrator → Can manage Power Pages but limited backend access.

VOA Portal Internal Viewer → Read-only access to backend records.

3️⃣ SRS Roles (Azure AD Teams)

What They Control:

✅ SRS Roles are Azure AD Teams that help manage internal user permissions at an organizational level.✅ These roles are mapped to Dataverse Security Roles, meaning they control internal users' access to backend systems like Dataverse & Dynamics 365.✅ Internal users are assigned an SRS role, which is mapped to a Dataverse Security Role.

How They Work:

📌 Azure AD Teams (SRS Roles) → Mapped to Dataverse Security Roles → Control access inside Dynamics/Dataverse.📌 Internal users do not directly use table permissions in Power Pages. Instead, they rely on security roles assigned via Azure AD Teams.

Your Configuration Example:

SRS Role: VOA Portal Admin → Mapped to VOA Portal Administrator Security Role.

SRS Role: VOA Portal Page Admin → Mapped to VOA Portal Page Administrator Security Role.

SRS Role: VOA Portal Viewer → Mapped to VOA Portal Internal Viewer Security Role.
