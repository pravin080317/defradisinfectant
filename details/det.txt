When a Power Pages site is deployed, Microsoft hosts it on an Azure App Service Plan in their own managed environment, which is normally not exposed in our Azure subscription.

However, Sherlin and KK have identified some App Service Plans in our Azure environment, and we need to verify if these are actually related to the LA Portal.

To confirm this, please:

Check the Application settings or tags for any references to Power Pages, Dataverse, or the portal URL.

Review the default Azure URL (e.g., *.azurewebsites.net) and see if it redirects to, or displays, the LA Portal site.
