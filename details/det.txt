Issue 1 – “Error summary focus” (WCAG 2.4.3 / P1)
What the audit reported

When an error is generated, the user is navigated to the top of the page instead of to the red error-summary banner.

That broke WCAG 2.4.3 Focus order:

Keyboard / screen-reader users had to Tab a long way to discover the error.

Low-vision users landed on a blank part of the page.

What was fixed

Added tabindex="-1" to #error-summary so it can receive programmatic focus.

In the error() function we now run
document.getElementById('error-summary').focus();
immediately after $("#error-summary").show();.

All previous window.scrollTo( … top:0 … ) calls were removed, so nothing forces the page up any more.

How the test team can validate
Step	Expected result (PASS criteria)
1. Open Upload multiple reports page. Do not choose a file.	—
2. Activate Add (click or press Space/Enter).	• Viewport does not jump to very top.
• Keyboard focus lands inside the red error summary.
• Screen-reader announces: “There is a problem – Select a file to upload”.
3. Press Tab once.	Focus moves to the error link inside the banner (“Select a file to upload”).
4. Press Enter on the link.	Focus moves to the file-upload control (<input type="file">).
5. Press Shift + Tab repeatedly.	Focus steps back through the guidance links in natural reverse order and eventually returns to the error banner. No unexpected jump to the bottom or top occurs.
6. Repeat the sequence at 200 % browser zoom / with a screen magnifier.
