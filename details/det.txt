### 🧭 Map Component Approach Summary – My View

We need an interactive mapping tool to support SBL and comparable sales workflows, but we also have to balance feasibility, refresh needs, performance, and platform constraints.

#### ✅ Data Freshness & Latency

* The current SBL works off a **twice-daily static dataset**, which works fine for now, but ideally we should aim for **near-real-time updates** via APIs (DAP2/VaaS).
* **Canvas OOB map** can fetch data on load or on filter change, but it can’t handle continuous streaming or large datasets. Re-querying after edits is possible, but not instant.
* **Custom PCF** offers better flexibility — we can cache, load by viewport, or use APIs directly. Could even link to Synapse feeds for fresher updates.
* **Power BI** is least suitable here. Even with DirectQuery, there's a lag. Not viable for interactive use.
* **External embedded map** (like the GEO team’s) gives us full control — can call APIs directly and show fresh data. We'll need to handle auth and cross-app comms, but this path gives us low-latency and reuse of proven tools.

#### 🚀 Performance & Scalability

* Canvas maps don’t scale well with large data (no clustering, no on-demand tiling).
* PCFs or external JS maps (e.g. Esri/Leaflet) are far better — we can implement clustering, optimize draw calls, or fetch only visible data via bounding boxes.
* GEO team already uses bounding box queries in Postgres, so we can reuse this.
* For smooth zoom/pan, external/PCF maps (e.g. using Mapbox or ArcGIS) are far superior.
* Canvas maps or Power BI visuals can lag or freeze with too many pins.

#### 🔁 Integration with Canvas UI (Filtering, Table Sync)

* **Canvas native map** supports input binding (filters → map), but doesn't easily expose outputs (map click → Canvas reaction).
* **PCF** is better: two-way data binding is possible. E.g. filters → PCF updates map, map interactions → output back to Canvas for table sync.
* **Power BI** again has poor integration — limited one-way filter passing. Drilldowns inside Power BI won't update Canvas UI.
* **External map** can integrate via `postMessage` in a PCF wrapper. For example, user draws a polygon → message posted → Canvas picks up and filters table. Requires some setup but fully feasible.

#### 🔄 Reuse of GEO/CTB Tools

* GEO already has a working sales viewer in JS with radius filters, polygons, etc.
* Instead of rebuilding in Power Apps, we can **embed that via iframe or wrap as PCF**.
* Similarly, CTB has Graph UI tools we could reuse for drag/drop charts (e.g. smoothening sliders).
* This keeps us aligned with tools already approved, avoids rework, and accelerates delivery.

### ✅ Final Recommendation (MVP Approach)

**Start with Option 4: Embedded External Map** (GEO Viewer inside Canvas page)

* Use existing GEO map to show pins, handle zoom, batch display, legend, and interactivity
* Canvas handles filters, data tables, and band edit navigation
* Implement minimal integration at first: filter via param passing, highlight pin on click
* Defer advanced features like polygon selection, band margin sliders to later

This keeps Phase 1 simple, delivers real value, and sets the stage for advanced interactivity later (possibly via PCF if tighter Canvas coupling is required).

### 🔧 Staged Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Polygon selection & radius filters** – enable user to select group of properties for batch rebanding.
2. **Drag-drop charts (AVM threshold tuning)** – reuse CTB tools where possible.
3. **PCF Wrapper** – if iframe limitations emerge, move to PCF version of GEO map.
4. **Layer toggles & legends** – add UX polish as performance permits.
5. **Advanced API wiring** – enable instant data refresh post-edit if backend supports it.

### 📌 Dependencies to Track

* DAP2/VaaS API readiness
* GEO service endpoint access
* Auth (SSO/token) for external tools
* PCF approval for JS libraries (e.g. Leaflet/D3)
* GEO/CTB resource availability and timelines

### 📝 Conclusion

Rather than reinvent the wheel, let's **orchestrate via Canvas**, delegate visuals to **GEO tools**, and iterate toward the full experience.
This gives us speed, performance, and flexibility — without overengineering Phase 1.
