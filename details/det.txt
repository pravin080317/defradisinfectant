Priority 1 ‚Äì Critical Accessibility & Usability Issues (must fix first)
Postcode input is too strict

Does not accept lowercase letters or postcodes without spaces (e.g., bs44ru or SW1A1AA).

Violates WCAG 2.2 SC 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (doesn‚Äôt help the user correct valid but variably formatted input).

Unclear or misleading error messages

Generic errors like ‚ÄúPostcode should be 5 to 8 characters‚Ä¶‚Äù are not specific enough.

Doesn‚Äôt explain what exactly is wrong or how to fix it (e.g., format, spacing, upper/lowercase).

Missing aria-describedby or aria-link references

Error messages are not programmatically associated with the input fields.

Screen reader users cannot determine which input the error is about.

Violates WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships and 4.1.3 Status Messages.

Redundant use of heading as label (<h1> + field label)

‚ÄúEnter the postcode for this property‚Äù is both a heading and acts like a label.

Confuses screen readers with multiple <h1>s and violates semantic hierarchy.

Incorrect field label associations

Screen readers may read labels twice or not at all due to incorrect or missing for attributes or implicit associations.

üüß Priority 2 ‚Äì Important UX / GDS Pattern Deviations
Use of (mandatory) label for required fields

Contradicts GOV.UK guidance: required fields should not be marked; only optional fields should be labeled as such.

Inconsistent usage across the form also adds confusion.

Address selection implemented with <select> instead of radio buttons

GOV.UK Design System recommends using radio buttons for accessibility:

Easier for keyboard navigation.

Prevents obscured addresses due to dropdown width.

Better support for screen readers.

Autocomplete missing on input

The postcode input is missing the autocomplete="postal-code" attribute.

Reduces usability for users relying on autofill or browser prediction.

üü® Priority 3 ‚Äì Minor / Structural Improvements
Multiple <h1> tags on the page

Multiple H1s can disrupt page structure and confuse assistive tech navigation.

Should follow proper heading hierarchy (h1, then h2, etc.).

Generic label text ('Postcode') not descriptive enough on its own

Relies on the heading for context.

Should either consolidate or make label more contextual (e.g., ‚ÄúPostcode for this property‚Äù).
