Absolutely, here’s an **updated, realistic comparison table** for all three options in Power Pages (LA Portal), explicitly calling out:

* **Development effort** (upfront and ongoing)
* **Accessibility** (with real risks)
* **ID/content management**
* **Governance/maintenance**
* **Page load/performance**
* **Overall risk**

This table assumes a portal with frequent structural updates and occasional new content blocks (not just static pages forever).

### **LA Portal Welsh Language Implementation – Options Comparison**

| Criteria                    | Option 1: Duplicate Pages (Separate URLs)                                                                        | Option 2: Dataverse Dynamic Swap                                                                                                                                       | Option 3: Inline Hide/Show                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev Effort (Upfront)**    | Moderate (duplicate all pages/templates, setup nav, content, markers for each language)                          | **Highest** (Dataverse schema, Liquid/JS fetch/inject, language toggles, unique IDs, ARIA/focus logic)                                                                 | **Lowest** (add both languages in every content block, simple JS toggle)                                                   |
| **Ongoing Effort**          | **High:** Any content, layout, or feature update must be done twice (risk of missing one); grows with site size. | **Low for translation/content updates. Moderate–high for page structure/UI changes:** New blocks require ContentID, Dataverse + template update, accessibility review. | **High:** All content changes must be made in every language, in every block, on every page; grows rapidly with site size. |
| **Accessibility**           | Good (clear separation, distinct URLs for each language; full page reload may break focus/context).              | Good **if ARIA/lang/focus handled in dynamic swap;** more dev needed to avoid confusion with screen readers.                                                           | Risky: Unless `aria-hidden`, focus, and DOM order managed, **screen readers may read both**; duplicate IDs are a risk.     |
| **ID & Content Management** | Simple (IDs per page/language, but must maintain in both).                                                       | Complex but scalable: **unique, stable ContentIDs for every block;** must coordinate portal and Dataverse changes.                                                     | Error-prone: duplicate IDs likely, especially if reusing markup; difficult to enforce at scale.                            |
| **Governance/Maintenance**  | Weak: No audit/version control; content drift risk; very hard to manage as site grows.                           | Strong for translations (central Dataverse); moderate for structure (requires process). Easy to audit, supports permissions.                                           | Weak: No central control, no audit/versioning; high chance of error as site grows.                                         |
| **Performance (Page Load)** | Fast (static, only one language per page loaded).                                                                | Fast (English); for Welsh, **slight delay for Dataverse fetch**—minimized if you bulk-fetch all for page, not per-block.                                               | Slower: Both languages in DOM for all users, **large pages, especially with rich content.**                                |
| **Overall Risk**            | High: Consistency, missed updates, hard to scale/maintain.                                                       | Medium: Upfront complexity, ongoing discipline needed for ID/accessibility; **lowest risk at scale once process is mature.**                                           | High: Accessibility, drift, duplicate IDs, errors—*not maintainable* for large or growing portals.                         |

### **Summary Points**

* **Option 1:** Only viable for very small, never-changing portals. **High long-term cost and risk.**
* **Option 2:** Best for 40–50+ pages. Initial dev/process investment is high (IDs, ARIA, JS), but **centralized, auditable, and scalable**. Ongoing effort is low for translation updates, but moderate for structural growth.
* **Option 3:** Suitable only for MVP/prototype or <5-page static sites. **Unmanageable and risky** for any larger, dynamic, or accessibility-compliant portal.
