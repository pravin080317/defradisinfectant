Here’s a clear, structured **test steps guide** for your team to validate the **“Upload Multiple Reports”** page accessibility fixes based on the reported issues and implemented solutions.

## ✅ **Test Plan: Accessibility & Usability – Upload Multiple Reports Page**

### 🔧 **Context:**

The page supports uploading bulk reports (CSV/XLS/XML) and dynamically transitions between:

* “Upload multiple reports” (initial screen)
* “Report ready for upload” (post file add)
* File removal and re-upload

### 📋 **Key Fixes Addressed:**

1. Back link now navigates correctly to "Upload multiple reports" screen.
2. Page transition message (“Report ready for upload…”) is announced by screen reader.
3. Visible `<h1>` heading is updated and focused.
4. ARIA live region added to announce state changes like "report removed."
5. File input does not override screen reader message (focus delay added).
