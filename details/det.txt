Subject: Confirmation on Application Insights Cookie Usage Disabled

Dear Team,

Following up on the previous discussion regarding cookie usage in our custom Application Insights implementation, I would like to confirm the latest outcome after our recent changes.

Background:
Previously, when telemetry was being sent from Power Pages using the Application Insights JavaScript SDK, we observed that the SDK was creating two specific cookies:

ai_user: Used to track a unique user ID across sessions.
ai_session: Used to track session data with a 30-minute inactivity timeout.
These cookies were automatically generated by the SDK to correlate telemetry data with users and sessions.

What We Have Done:
We have updated the telemetry script to explicitly disable cookie usage by setting the following configuration:

javascript
Copy
Edit
disableCookiesUsage: true
Additionally, we ensured that when setting the authenticated user context, we included the flag to prevent storing user context in cookies:

javascript
Copy
Edit
appInsights.setAuthenticatedUserContext(userId, undefined, true);
Outcome After Changes:
Upon re-testing, we confirm that no Application Insights related cookies (ai_user or ai_session) are being created or used.
We validated this by:
Clearing all browser cookies.
Reloading the page and inspecting the browserâ€™s Application > Cookies section.
No ai_user or ai_session cookies were detected.
Telemetry is still being sent, but without persistent cookie usage.
Conclusion:
Cookies for telemetry are now fully disabled.
This ensures compliance with privacy and security best practices while still capturing necessary telemetry data.
Please let us know if you need further validation steps, screenshots, or if there are additional measures you'd like us to take.
