Draft Email for Topic 2: Performance Analyst Role & Access for Andrew
Subject: Access for Performance Analyst (Andrew) – Day 1 & Day 2 Approach

Hi Team,

Following our discussions regarding Andrew McNeil’s access requirements for retrieving LA Portal data, we have outlined the Day 1 (short-term) and Day 2 (long-term) approach.

Day 1 – Immediate Access in SIT & PROD
Andrew has been assigned the "VOA - BST Programme Read Only User" role in SIT to test whether he can retrieve the required data.
Action Required: Can you confirm if this role allows him to run the necessary queries successfully?
Next Step: If the role in SIT meets his requirements, will Andrew be granted the same role in PROD to run queries in the live environment?
Ownership: Who from the team will be responsible for assigning this role in PROD?
Day 2 – Future Role for Performance Analysts
A new dedicated SRS role will be created for Performance Analysts to extract reports and analyze LA Portal data.
This role needs to be defined, reviewed, and approved by business stakeholders before implementation.
Next Steps:
Identify the exact access requirements for Andrew & Performance Analysts.
Decide whether to reuse or modify an existing role (e.g., VOA - BST Programme Read Only User) or create a new role.
Get business approval for the new role before provisioning in the system.
Implement and test the new role before enabling in PROD.
Key Questions for Day 1 Implementation
Is Andrew's access in SIT sufficient for his data retrieval needs?
Who will be assigning the VOA - BST Programme Read Only User role to Andrew in PROD?
Are there any dependencies or blockers in providing this access?
Looking forward to your confirmation and next steps.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
