I’d like to provide a clear distinction between the two separate asks from Andrew  to avoid any confusion:

1. Retrieving Logs from Azure Entra ID (Day 1 Ask) – No SRS Role Involvement
Andrew’s primary request is to obtain login-related logs from Azure Entra ID for LA Portal users. This is specifically related to authentication tracking and has nothing to do with SRS roles.

The data he is looking for includes:

User ID of the logged-in LA Portal user
Login status (success/failure)
Login timestamp
Council details associated with the user
This is strictly an Azure Entra ID data extraction task and does not require any permissions within Dataverse or Power Platform. To fulfill this request, we need assistance from someone in the Azure Identity Management team who has the necessary access to retrieve logs from Entra ID and confirm whether this data is available for extraction.

2. Assigning SRS Roles for Backend Access (Internal Team Ask)
Separately, Andrew has an internal request for his access within Dataverse, which involves SRS role assignment. This is unrelated to the login tracking logs and is about allowing him to access back-end transactional data related to LA Portal.

This second request is being handled internally by Rob, and it involves assigning the appropriate SRS roles that provide Andrew with access to Dataverse for deeper analysis. This process is separate from the Day 1 request for login logs and does not require Cloud Team involvement.
